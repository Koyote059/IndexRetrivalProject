I really like the phone, but Samsung gives ZERO support for an "unlocked phone" none 
at all, they refer you to the seller.The quick start guide was not enough for 
me, and they (Samsung) would not talk to me about it at all. After being 
very pushy they finally provided links to the full manuals in both English and Spanish.hopefully 
my links will appear:[...][...]PS: see comment for links that did not appear aboveAfter using the 
phone for a few weeks I see that Wifi reception is difficult. Need a very 
strong signal.
