Read all the reviews but when Clark Howard recommended the Moto G4 that sealed the 
deal. My wife lost most of her hearing several years ago and has had trouble 
hearing on the phone. I let her use the G4 and now I have to 
buy one for her since she was able hear clearly on mine. I've been using 
a Moto X for several years and I love having all the extra memory.
