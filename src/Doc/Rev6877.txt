I am a college student who was in desperate need of a new cell phone 
after my old one stopped working. Because of that I wanted to buy a phone 
truly worth the money, and one that would last.For someone who isn't willing to pay 
for 3G service, but still wants internet, and a modern looking phone, THIS is the 
perfect cell phone. Phones like this are very hard to come by because most do 
require data packages (the ones considered smartphones anyway). I can't say how it compares to 
a smartphone having never owned one, but for someone like me it's perfect.- QWERTY keyboard 
is well spaced, text messaging capabilities are wonderful- WIFI! Can I stress how important this 
is? It's probably the best feature of the phone. Wi-Fi is pretty much everywhere nowadays, 
so why buy a smartphone when you can get a phone with Wi-Fi capabilities for 
a much lower price, and without having to buy a data plan?I've had it for 
about 3 weeks now and I have absolutely no complaints. The battery lasts about 3-4 
days and that's with a good number of hours using it (mostly texting or listening 
to music).So if you want to buy something definitely worth the money that not only 
functions great but LOOKS great, this is the phone for you. Best $120 I ever 
spent!
