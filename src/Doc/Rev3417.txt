At first I was excited to get this new smartphone. Inspite of the newness I 
am disappointed. It seems there is "limited-at-best product help available. It seems as though this 
phone was someone's after-thought and ditched it right away. Truth be told I would skip 
on this phone the next time and choose something a bit more in use. It's 
a good enough phone I suppose. It has it's flaws which for the most part 
can be overlooked considering the price. It looks pretty but when BLU gets it's act 
together maybe they'll make a better product.
