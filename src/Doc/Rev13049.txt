The nature of my work makes me move and stay to different countries for months 
at a time so i needed an unlocked phone. I found that's not something easy 
to get in US. Phone stores would even sell you a locked phone at a 
full prize if you don't buy a contract, that's ridiculous. I've been to he Nokia 
store in NYC and I would have paid 100USD more than on Amazon for the 
same product. I'm very happy with my purchase, the phone came in perfect condition in 
a sealed box. The Symbian program allows you to synchronize documents with your computer, it's 
a great tool. I would recommend buying a protection for the screen, gets scratched easily 
(Invisible Shield is great)
