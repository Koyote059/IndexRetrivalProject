Very pleased with this phone. Android version 4.1.2 and has not been upgraded from the 
manufacture, but it does run everything I want so it is acceptable. I need a 
dual SIM phone to separate my home/personal use from work, and this fits the bill. 
Internal storage is small, but I understand the cost of the phone, so I can 
tolerate that. I am not a gamer and only use it for calls, tasks, IM 
and email and some social networking. Only 3G so it is not as fast as 
some phones. I live in the mid-west of the United States on the T-Mobile system 
and reception is as good as other phones I have had. I do like this 
phone, small and easy to use. I would recommend this phone to others who just 
need a simple smart phone. I am sure my teenager would need/want a more powerful 
device, but this one fits my needs.
