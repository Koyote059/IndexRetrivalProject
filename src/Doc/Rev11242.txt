This phone was awesome for the one hour that it worked the pictures it took 
looked great the porcessor was decently fast and ran youtube like a charm. And for 
those of you who have cricket yes it will automatically pick up your wireless signal 
and display on the dropdown menu cricket 3g or 4g. But having said what the 
positive thigns about htis phone was it crashed and got a green screen which then 
turned red and then would not respond to factory data reset or battery being taken 
out and placed back in. All in all what looked like a great deal turned 
outto dissapoint me, remmeber when buying this phone or this brand it is known but 
not extremely well known so you run the risk of getting a phone that will 
burn out early.
