Of the 5 Blue phones I tried and returned, this one was probably the best, 
but not good enough cause I still had to return it. Sometimes it was OK 
for just doing phone stuff, but anything that used processor and ram made it glitchy. 
Several games made it crashed. Sometime I could not answer a call, would ring and 
ring and I could not unlock it.
