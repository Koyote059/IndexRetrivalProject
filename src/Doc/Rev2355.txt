My parents are in their 80s so the larger buttons are a plus. The phone 
is only 2G, a bummer. The big problem is no user guide. I downloaded the 
guide I found on line, but it is worthless. It doesn't provide any instructions. I 
contacted the company and they were no help either. Sorry I bought this one.
