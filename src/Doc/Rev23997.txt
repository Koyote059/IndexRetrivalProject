I had this phone in 2009 and after 2 and a half years it wore 
out. I couldn't get another one from the at&t store so I went with the 
AT&T Evergreen , I didn't like it at all so I went to a Blackberry.,though 
that had some VERY real strengths to it it still wasn't for me.I then resigned 
myself to an AT&T go phone . Someone suggested that I look around on Amazon 
for any spare Propels lying around and by golly I found some. I got 2 
of them for 50 bucks each and couldn't be happier. Its easily opened and closed 
with one hand and my screen wallpaper is a photo of a fluorescent light . 
Its bright and white and when I slide my phone open its bright enough to 
read by.An EXCELLENT makeshift flashlight and though this phone doesnt have the latest bells and 
whistles (and there are some awesome ones out there) I am VERY happy with it.
