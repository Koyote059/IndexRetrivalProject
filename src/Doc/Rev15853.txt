This is a very good phone. Has a middle size: not too big not too 
small, so it fit well in any hand (it is been used by my 13 
years daughter). The phone comes with Android 2.3 but the HTC delivered the 4.0.3 Android 
version. The camera makes very beautiful pictures (a little yellow when using the flash in 
very lower light conditions).
