I had the note 3. This thing blows it out of the water. Much much 
faster than the note 3. Or iPhone anything. And the battery life is amazing. I 
unplug it at 4:45 am and at 11 pm I still have almost half battery 
life left. With iPhone or note 3, I had to plug it in as soon 
as I got home. All the important apps are available. So you really won't miss 
much making the switch to windows 8. Love watching Netflix on my lunch break with 
this phone. Amazing screen quality, awesome camera. Speedy web browser. Near instant app launch. You 
won't be disappointed.
