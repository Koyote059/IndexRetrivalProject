This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. 
Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. 
I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, 
I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back 
to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it 
was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my 
messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the 
Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I 
was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 
9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great 
but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future 
models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my 
music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half 
of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had 
in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's 
either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse 
the fact that I have big fingers. Lol.
