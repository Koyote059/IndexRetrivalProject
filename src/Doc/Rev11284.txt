This phone looked ok for a few days but, within 2 weeks of using it, 
the touch screen doesn't work 100% in the middle of screen I can't use some 
characters. I can't type some characters, screen is useless, it doesn't recognize finger or stylus 
in the middle of the screen. That's what we get for getting a cheap phone.
