Truly a great phone. The connectivity is the thing that blew me away the most. 
My wife has an Iphone 6+, I have a Nexus 6, and the Mate 7 
was always pulling in significantly better signal no matter where we were. Especially in the 
big box store buildings, I would have almost no service on the Nexus 6, and 
the Mate 7 would have full bars LTE. The battery life is exceptional. It would 
be a hard task to drain this battery in a day of heavy usage. The 
display is bright and the quality descent. Another thing to mention is that the headphone 
amplifier is truly above reproach. It was able to push more volume and block out 
more electronic noise(Like humming, buzzing, even while charging) than the HTC One M8 which to 
me has had the best audio amplifier for a while. Then when it comes to 
the rear facing speaker, it's terrible. The speaker quality is bad, and it's facing in 
the wrong direction.Pros:Battery LifeHeadphone PreampConnectivityScreen BrightnessCameraDesignVery fast phoneCons:Screen Quality(Just not as good as some of
