I bought this as a last resort as I had broken a phone and needed 
a quick replacement. I believe people like me were the niche for this product - 
desperate customer looking for a quick fix. This phone has very limited capabilities in its 
initial version. Once you've updated it, the phone SLOWS DOWN IMMENSELY. I've had my phone 
freeze and drop in the middle of a call with someone. This phone is outdated 
or refurbished or something, in any case it is NOT WORTH $230. Invest a few 
more $100 into an actual working phone.
