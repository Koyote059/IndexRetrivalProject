This is a very unique phone, im a lover of android and gave up Nexus 
4 because the Kit Kat update was messing with the phones' OS.The Windows 8 phone 
isn't perfect but with some more update for some added option a la android style 
with will make it even better which i think is to come sometime this year 
2014. I'm still getting the hang of the features but in general im impressed.
