I was very satisfied with Amazon on the shipment and customer service. As far as 
the watch, I purchased it for my son to use with his iPhone 4s. also 
I like the fact that you could put a sim card in it and use 
it as a phone. unfortunately when you put a sim card in it it doesn't 
accept any of the Services. also on the Apple system it doesn't really do much 
with Bluetooth. if I was to do it all over again, I would have bought 
a Samsung gear. I have a gear 2 and it does everything expected to do.
