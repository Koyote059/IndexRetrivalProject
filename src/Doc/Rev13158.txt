Ive had galaxy PHONES S2,S3,S4,S5 AND THIS PHONE IS RIGHT UP THERE BUT IT DOESN'T 
FREEZES LIKE THE GALAXY LINE,BUT WARNING! IT NEEDS TO USE ONLY SPECIFIC CHARGER,MY BATERY WAS 
DAMAGED BUT I SEND POSH AN EMAIL AND THEY SENDED ME A NEW ONE FOR 
FREE,THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE,I DONT LIVE WITH THE FEAR OF BRAKING MY PHONE CAUSE ITS NOT 
LIKE LOOSING $700+ LIKE OTHER BRANDS,WITH $120 TO$180 YOU CAN BUY ANOTHER ONE IF AFTER 
THE YEAR WARRANTY YOU BRAKE OR LOOSE IT,THIS IS FOR THE POSH TEAM:KEEP YOUR GOOD 
WORK AND BELIVE THAT YOUR COMPANY IS AND CAN MAKE THE DIFERENCE,ILL SUPPORT YOU BY
