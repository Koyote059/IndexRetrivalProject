i bought this phone as a back up for my evo 4g lte and when 
i needed to activate it sprint couldnt. so i decided to use it as a 
music phone and when the volume up decided it wanted to break i took the 
phone apart and there were fingerprints all over the motherboard. and i know they wernt 
mine. i love this phone to this day it serves me well but when i 
truely needed this phone to be activated sprint tried everything in their power and the 
phone would not activate. i apologize if this is directed at the wrong people but 
check your damn phones before you shippem out also the camera only works about 30% 
of the time and that was even bore i took the phone apart.
