The phone is great. I like the functionality as it has all the applications that 
I need. There is drawback - nowhere in the description it is mentioned the cell 
phone is affiliated with AT&T. That is hugely unfair - this information should be present. 
Thankfully, the cell phone worked with T-Mobile. The device is great, the not mentioned AT&T 
affiliation is just bad, that just completely erodes my credibility to the seller - I 
will avoid this establishment in the future by all means. An easy way to break 
a nice business relationship. :)
