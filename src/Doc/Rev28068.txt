I feel cheated.Since I received the phone note that the flash of the camera was 
low, never worked properly, four months just stopped working, the imei code was deleted, and 
started presenting software failures, now dead. I was promised an original samsung computer but apparently 
is a copy at the same cost of an original. I need an answer about 
the warranty.
