This took a week to ship, and for an impatient 13 year old boy, that's 
frustrating. However, it was totally worth the wait. It came in the original packaging, sealed. 
Also, it came with 1 screen protector and two of the black iPhone 5c cases 
that cost $30 at Apple.com! The screen protector and the cases are a $70 value. 
Plus, the phone was $150 less than the cost Apple! Such a great deal. I'm 
loving my first smartphone :D
