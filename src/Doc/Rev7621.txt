The phone I received was a lemon and the person who sent it would not 
take it back. Fortunately, it was a phone that still was under the 1-year manufacturer's 
warranty. When I went back to the Verizon store, the attendant could see that the 
phone was malfunctioning and they set up a new phone to come to my house 
to switch it out. Very good service, Verizon.
