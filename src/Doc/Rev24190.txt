This phone was purchased -like new- from a seller on Amazon. The menus are straight 
forward. My personal opinion is that Nokia's menus are the easiest to use.The battery on 
this phone records a long time. I made a video recording (3gp) the other day-off 
a fully charged battery- which recorded for 7 (seven) hours. The battery will record audio 
(amr) for 10 to 15 hours without the ac adapter being plugged into the electric.The 
point is that there are no time limits on the recordings. You end the recording 
manually or the battery runs out.And, if you record while the ac adapter is plugged 
in and have a large size micro sd card you could probably record for a 
couple of days.Ok, I'm a gadget person.The phone will hold up to a 32 gb 
micro sd card. With the usb cable, transferring data to a pc is time consuming. 
Better to use the adapter card that comes with micro sd card if your computer 
has a slot for it.The backlighting won't turn off when recording video. Probably some way 
to achieve this which I haven't had time to figure out.Most cell phone companies have 
sim cards which will work in this phone. Even cdma companies. You must contact them. 
Perusing the company web site is best but time consuming, however, its good to see 
the info in writing. Check it out.Best
