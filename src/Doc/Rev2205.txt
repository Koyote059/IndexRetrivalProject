I absolutely LOVE THIS PHONE! I just did a "forced upgrade" from my previous phone, 
Sony Xperia Z1s to this, Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. The reason I say "forced upgrade" 
is due to the fact that my screen broke after about 2+ Years of service, 
I wouldn't have upgraded if it wasn't for that. Anyway I been having this phone 
on my radar since it was released, so I bought it. Seller shipped it quick, 
and it arrived ahead of time! :D The phone itself is awesome and the 4K 
is beautiful! The PS4 Remote Play feature is a HUGE PLUS! Works great, a little 
laggy at times but playable. The Chrome background is nice and camera is flawless. Phone 
is FAST! I received a Chinese Version of this phone, and I am using T-Mobile 
USA. The 4G LTE works but does not display, but with a Internet Speed Test 
you will see it is there. All in all, solid phone, and great purchase! 5 
STARS!
