I got this as a replacement/upgrade from my Droid 2 global, and I am not 
really impressed. The speaker volume is a lot lower than the droid 2, the power 
button does not always respond to the first push and the phone is heavier.I do 
like the updates to the slide out keyboard. The number keys are separate so you 
don't have to use the ALT key to type in a number.Over all it works, 
and serves it's purpose as a 3G phone.
