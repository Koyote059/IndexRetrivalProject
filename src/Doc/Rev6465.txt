Speakers will randomly crackle for absolutely no reason. Even when the phone is not being 
used it will randomly start making noise like it is trying to play sound but 
he speaker wires are loose.When they are not crackling phone works great.Three stars because I 
shouldn't have to turn the phone off every time I enter a library or classroom. 
(Can't just put it on silent or airlane mode. Will still act up for no 
reason)
