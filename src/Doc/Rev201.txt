I received the phone fast from 2-day shipping but I am disappointed with it. I 
returned it the same day! It doesn't look like in pictures, the color is off 
white and is not shiny but very dull looking. The slider is wobbly and loose 
so it doesn't feel good in the hand. I've always thought Nokia products were well 
made but this phone just felt cheap. I had the Nokia C3 before and even 
it feels higher quality.The Symbian OS is nothing to boast about but i knew that, 
however the touchscreen is quite annoying because you have to double tap to select something, 
if you tap once a "tip" pops up instead. It's okay for the price, but 
there are better phones that cost the same or just a little more like the 
Samsung Wave 533 or the LG GW620.
