Great phone, but loaded with ATT bloat ware. Don't know if T Mobile version (851) 
is any less trashed, but I do know updating Android with unlocked T-Mobile lg g3 
doesn't require update pushed by carrier, so the D851 would be more versatile. Battery life 
short, this device is an energy hog...but extra batteries are cheap, so is a minor 
problem.
