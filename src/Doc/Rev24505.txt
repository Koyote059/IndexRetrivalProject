First off I would like to say this phone was a good idea from the 
start but at the end it's just a joke please don't buy this device it 
slows down all the time screen becomes unresponsive all the time the device will randomly 
lock up to where you have to push and hold the power key and vol 
down buttons to restart the device if you don't use speaker phone people can't hear 
you it will take about 45 secs for the phone to dial out and the 
battery starts to wear down after about a week of use I tried to return 
the device but was told that I had to return in 14 days of delivery 
which I don't have another phone to use while this phone gets sent back so 
please save your self the headache and don't buy this device.
