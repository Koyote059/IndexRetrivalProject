I love every aspect about this phone except one that I feel is monumental in 
pointing out.Its Wi-Fi.It's spotty.I can be sitting in the room with my wireless router and 
my Wi-Fi signal will fluctuate from full to dropped multiple times in a short period 
of time. It is angering as I have a low data per month plan and 
rely on Wi-Fi often. When the Wi-Fi is connected, it's great and works wonderfully, unfortunately 
though, that's quite hit-or-miss. My old phone & Google Nexus have significant better reception than 
the phone.Again, aside from the Wi-Fi issue, the phone is great. I would recommend it 
to anyone.
