I've bought several Blu phones over the last 4 years and overall I think they 
are a great buy for the money.I returned a Vivo xl before buying this as 
there were many issues I didn't like with that phone. I did a review on 
that one also.Starting off with this one seemed very familiar with my previous life XL.Here's 
my negatives so far after a month and a half.1) Notifications (again) Most of my 
app notifications do not sound. They worked for a while, now most don't.Don't know if 
it's me or the phone. I some cases, I will set a tone and after 
hitting ok, it will reset to none.2) incoming calls. There is supposed to be a 
drop down Dismiss/Answer box to handle the call.Most of the time it doesn't show up, 
or if it's hidden, I don't know how to open it. Really frustrating.3) Still don't 
know if connecting LTE, no icon I can see. I'm assuming it does.4) there are 
only 2 pages available for apps? Not a big negative for me, as the app 
icon at the bottom is now back (missing on the vivo xl)5) I also had 
trouble connecting to windows to get pictures off (same with vivo xl). Found solutions online. 
Should be simple plug in featurePluses.I did find a 64gb card that worked.SanDisc. My Vivo 
would not accept any brand.the back is easy to remove as they have put a 
notch back in it. Vivo did not have and was near impossible to get off. 
Only place was to use the charg port edge to pry off.
