I've had mine since April - the phone rarely Rings now for incoming calls and 
has been do the past few weeks. This is a BIG ISSUE for me as 
I am on-call 24/7. I just emailed ZTE Support after downloading the latest app updates 
to see if any would resolve the issue. I am waiting to see if I 
get satisfactory warranty support.
