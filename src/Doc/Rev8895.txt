Really wonderful phone. So glad Blackberry combined with Android to make such a phenomenal phone.PROS:Beautiful 
ScreenGreat Blackberry apps and featuresBlackberry full encryption securityloud front speakerAwesome battery lifevery functional slide out 
keyboardHigh quality build overallNice cameraCONS: (nitpicking not really cons)low-ish quality front camera (doesn't bother me 
at all)If you are much faster with touchscreen keyboard, the physical keyboard can end up 
feeling uselessI was between this phone and the Moto X Pure Edition. I decided to 
try this one first. I really did love it. Everything is very smooth on it. 
Blackberry has created one of the lightest and smoothest launchers and features. Blackberry hub is 
really neat especially for people who are constantly communicating over multiple mediums. In the end 
tho I felt as if I would be happier with a Moto X (and I 
am) mostly because I just did not feel like I put the keyboard to use, 
as good as it is, because I have become so efficient with the Google keyboard. 
I gave this phone to my dad because he missed his Blackberrys of old. He 
loves this phone. It's basically the perfect blend of all the wonderful things a Blackberry 
should have with the efficiency and utility of Android. Highly recommend this phone to anyone 
looking for a physical keyboard.
