First off, this product was advertised as if it was a new item, but it 
is a used phone, and this was locked to the At&t network, as the product 
description says this is an unlocked phone, however it is not, I had to go 
to AT & T's website to get this unlocked. Then the flash on this phone 
did not work, probably caused it's a used phone and the feature might have been 
broken. Returned this phone and got one from a different store.
