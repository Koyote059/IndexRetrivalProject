I bought two of these phones in different colors for my high school aged twins. 
The phones worked great and they loved them. The problem came when they were prompted 
to "update" the phone. When they did the update it fried the phone. | guess 
because it is an international version- I really don't know. The tech guy at our 
local ATT store couldn't do anything with it. A friend who has done "Rooting" on 
numerous android phones couldn't fix it either. The phone lost its operating system when it 
updated and would not accept a new one.If you can use the phone and NEVER 
update it you may have a good phone. But definitely not worth the money for 
6 months of use!
