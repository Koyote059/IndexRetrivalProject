I had this phone for 2 weeks, it worked just fine only thing is i 
made a mistake and sat on it, i forgot it was in my pocket. Now 
the touchscreen doesn't work period!! If a great case was sold for this phone that 
maybe wouldn't have happened. Now i have no phone. Im just gonna stick with a 
Samsung Galaxy phone. All in all the phone was good to use.
