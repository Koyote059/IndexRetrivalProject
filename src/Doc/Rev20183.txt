Excellent phone: light-weight, small enough to put in a pocket even while in a sleeve, 
superb contrast in display, great battery life, sound quality, and fast processor. Also, Samsung has 
used its top-of-the-line camera in the phone. It is not designed for heavy gaming, video 
or music work. My only reservation is that the phone is so new in the 
U.S. that Verizon (my first choice) was unable to activate it. Samsung hoped to release 
it last spring to general public, but as of 10/16, they have not done so. 
On a friend's recommendation, I went to T-Mobile for service They easily made it work. 
Even then, they had to go to their tech support to find a way to 
set up voice mail. Within a day, a tech rep was able to send me 
a sofware patch that made that function work. Warning to potential buyers: My phone came 
from Amazon. You must buy a phone that can work in the American networks. If 
a phone is advertised as "international" model, (Sweden and Great Britain have had it available 
for at least 6 months) be sure you have a guarantee that will take it 
back if it doesn't work.
