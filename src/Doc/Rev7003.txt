this is a fake the seller never contacted with me , when the phone came 
to my hands it was in really bad state the case was really bad the 
plastic in the edges was falling off and the phone after few days of use 
began to fail it will automaticly reboot alone after a week of use the phone 
didnt turn on again really dont know if the product is a falsification
