I can say I was truely deceived. The phone was described as Factory Unlocked but 
I was shocked to discover that the phone is locked even as I write this 
review. I wrote to Amazon and they gave me back $25 for each of the 
phone for me to unlock it in my local. The issue is that I have 
not been able to do that.
