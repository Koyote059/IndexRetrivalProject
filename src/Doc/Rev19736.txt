Well built. Decent performance. We use this phone just for phone calls and texts....it replaces 
our old landline service. Call quality is excellent on Republic Wireless. No hesitations. I like 
the BLU R1 HD slightly more, but that phone isn't supported on Republic so I 
bought this one instead. It is louder (good), screen is similar (ok), software is similarly 
vanilla Android (very good). Amazon ads are unobtrusive.
