I wanted an unlocked Smart phone, and didn't want Windows Mobile, and of course iPhone 
was out. That left Symbian or first release of Android. N97 ended up in my 
pocket.First, the good. Except for the minimal memory this hardware is tremendous. Yes, the phone 
is big and heavy, but it is also nearly bullet-proof, and the keyboard is fine. 
Really it could replace any netbook/tablet for the uses they have been built for.Now, the 
bad. I went around and around, finally rating the phone for a 2. It's because 
of the way Symbian runs, and the small working memory (the only hardware shortcoming). This 
phone could easily be a 4 star or better except I am so tired of 
working around the "memory full" error, and the lack of apps. And apparently that is 
because even for my unlocked phone, Nokia has it wrapped up so tight that about 
half of the apps I want to install need hacks to get it done. And 
that's the crux of the biscuit, this great hardware is hobbled by the way it's 
applications are controlled. Mozilla has skipped developing for Symbian 5 and created a Fennec browser 
for Maemo, but I won't get locked into this lack of apps again. I'll be 
moving to an Android phone soon.End of MayThe minimal memory has become a very frustrating 
issue. No matter what I do, once or twice a month I spend an hour 
messing with that. It is SUCH a shame that this phone isn't great, because it 
could be so easily. It will be Motorola or HTC Android 2.1 soon.
