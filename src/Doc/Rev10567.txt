The build of this phone is so soft small drops will end up being a 
huge dent. Disappointed with the quality of this phone 3rd blu smartphone I've own. The 
more i progress with this phone the more i regret this horribly constructed parer weight 
I've had this phone for slightly over 3 months. wont last a year spend a 
bit more for a better built phone do not go cheap.BTW the gps sucks so 
if you try to play pokemon go you will want to pull your hair out.
