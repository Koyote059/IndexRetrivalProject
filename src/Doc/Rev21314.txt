Price/Performance of this phone is great!Since my expensive/high performing LG G4 phone broke with a 
"bootloop" (and will not be repaired) I needed a fast and cheap replacement for my 
phone - since I was traveling to Europe two days later.The phone was delivered in 
time - and actually was much better than expected.Of course, it is very slow (especially 
compared to my old phone - but the price was more than 10 times higher) 
- and sometimes you have to be a little bit patience if you use it 
- but, hey - you can not expect to get an Iphone for this price!The 
phone does not have a lot of memory, so I get an additional SanDisk SD 
card (since I mainly use the my phone to listen to music) - and it 
worked well.I can use my standard apps (hangouts/whatsapp/facebook/mail/googlemaps)You don't want to write long mails on 
this device - but for short chats, it works well.Although I will get a better 
phone in the future, I will keep this phone as my "backup phone" - and 
take it to festivals or konzerts - so to places, where I don't want to 
loose my "good"phone. Another advantage is that is is very small, so it fits in 
every trouser pocket.The camera is kind of useless - I could not make a nice 
picture, the resultion is realy bad - but besides of this, I totally happy with 
this phone.
