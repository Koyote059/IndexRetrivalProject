I bought this phone for my brother-in-law to us in Jamaica. I wasn't sure how 
i was going to test the phone to make sure it is unlocked till I 
found out it uses a nano chip now instead a macro. This was perfect because 
I have an iphone so I was able to use my sim card from Jamaica 
to test it out and It worked: texting and calling without wifi and then the 
wifi worked well on it's own with the data service off. I don't know much 
about the Samsung's Galaxy but I was able to move around apps and the home 
screen pretty easily. I don't know if the feature on the top right of the 
screen for speed dial was always there but I liked that feature. He will be 
happpy when he gets his new "toy" . The camera works well too!One thing to 
mention is that I found it odd that the Samsung seal on the box was 
broken but the company selling this said this was their doing to ensure the adapter 
that came with it was in fact from Europe. And to make sure all the 
components were in there. It was nice of them to give me a Type A 
plug( the ones used in the US and other parts of the Western Hemisphere)When he 
get's the phone I will update my review if he has anything to add.
