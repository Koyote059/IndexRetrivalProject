I like the style and fit of this watch. It is a comfortable watch, I 
sometimes forget I have it on my wrist! I love the fit and comfort. Obviously 
you need an iPhone to maximize the features the watch. I purchased the steel watch 
as it has the sapphire screen. I am active and need the protection. The Stainless 
Steel case 42 mm watch can be found for much less the the retail price 
these days as Apple may be preparing a newer version of this watch. I paid 
under $400 for this watch and it is well worth it.
