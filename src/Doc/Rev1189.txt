Purchased this to replace an Iphone 5S which was dropped in water. It arrived quickly 
and in good condition. I started with an android phone but moved to IOS when 
upgrading. Both have their perks but coming back to this phone reminded me how much 
I missed the simplicity of Android. This seems to have much less bloatware than other 
galaxy phones I've seen and for a $150 phone, it starts up and opens apps 
pretty quickly. Phone calls are average for hearing the other party(I'm not sure how I 
sound to others). The sound put through the on board speaker and headphone jack are 
weak (Lacks lower end on the headphone output). Overall this phone does exactly what I 
need, makes texts, makes calls, GPS on Google Maps, checking Email, and gives me internet 
access.I did have a problem initally with AT&T service. I could make calls and text, 
but couldn't use data. I used this site:[...]to set up a new access point for 
data and everything has worked since.TLDR:Pros:QuickGood Battery LifeSimplicity isn't always badNot much bloatwareRemovable BatterySD Card
