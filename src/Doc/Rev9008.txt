I have had this phone for the past six months and I must that that 
I am not disappointed. The only draw back I have is that it does not 
have a notification light indicator. In addition there are times it reboots automatically which can 
be a bit irritating. It does not happen often enough for me discard the phone 
but it is a bug I think BLU should fix. The rear and front cameras 
work fine. The photo quality is not superb but it does the job. It is 
pretty reliable and handles well. It is faster than I expected when I first got 
it so I was impressed. It is a great buy for someone who wants a 
decent smartphone but cannot afford the major brands such Samsung, iPhone etc.It will give you 
a leg up in the price department
