This phone is great and i received it new and in record time. However it 
is not supported by T-Mobile any more so you can use the apps or get 
online and every time you allow the phone to die or take the battery out 
you lose all contacts unless stored to your sims card which i hate. But on 
the plus side i am extremely cheap and refuse to pay hundreds for a cell 
phone and this one is a great price. If you don't mind not having internet 
access this is a wonderful phone. And for a while I didn't care but now 
i want to GPS and FB with my phone so I must move on.
