This phone is amazing! I generally love sony phones as they are the only company 
sensible enough to still make smartphones for people with small hands! The camera is amazing 
and the phone performance is pretty good. Having said that - here are a few 
potential issues that buyers need to keep in mind:1) AS soon as you connect to 
wi-fi, the user is prompted to upgrade the OS or update to the latest version. 
I would not recommend that users do it unless they are absolutely sure that the 
versiohn they are upgrading to supported all the features of the phone. I have seen 
people complaining about the camera on the newer OS versions. For all practical purposes, the 
OS that comes with the phone is good enough as is and supports the latest 
versions of all apps.2) I bought a tempered glass protective cover to go with the 
phone. I was a bit concerned about the glass cracking issue that others have reported, 
but I took the risk anyway. I will update the review if something else goes 
wrong. :)
