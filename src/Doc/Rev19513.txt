It's a pretty good deal, but you get what you pay for. This phone has 
weird quirks. Feels very buggy. I use the crap out of my phones though so 
I'm sure it would be great for someone who only uses it for calling, texting, 
and internet. I do 3D modeling on mine. Just kidding, that would be outrageous and 
very difficult. I do use it for navigation, Pandora, Instagram, Hill Climb Racing, internet, texting, 
calling, and general jagaloonery. The camera isn't bad. I do wish it had an auto 
dimming/brightening feature for the screen, but just download a widget that lets you adjust it 
and you're fine. I don't understand why you have to press "OK" after entering your 
PIN to unlock it, but whatever. Oh also it's a great compact size. Fits well 
in the pocket. The vibrator sucks. I never feel it vibrate. Oh and a couple 
times the clock was off by a couple hours and my alarm didn't go off. 
It's an adventure, this phone. You never know what's going to happen. It's like oh 
hey let me call Janice and you press the numbers and hit dial and you 
don't know if it's going to call Janice right away, 2 minutes from now, or 
never! hahahaha!!!! I will say it's better than an iPhone in that if someone stole 
my friend's iPhone and smashed it with a hammer he would be heart broken that 
he lost all that money, whereas if a hooligan snatched my Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G 
from me and smashed it with a hammer I would just laugh and then by 
like 3 more of these for the price of an iPhone. Also, I tell people 
it's the Galaxy Xzibit. Some people believe me. Others do not know who Xzibit is.
