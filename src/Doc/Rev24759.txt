I was soo sketchy at first about this phone being unlocked after reading bad reviews 
people had of it. so far so good i had this phone for almost 2 
weeks now and its been amazing. I have t-mobile and omg the speed on this 
device for a 3g phone is amazingly fast compared to my t-mobile samsung galaxy exhibit 
2. I went through a lot of exchanges with that phone withint 2 weeks. This 
unlocked phone came brand new as it says here and i was really excited for 
it. If you really need an affordable replacement phone this Lg Quantum is the way 
to go.
