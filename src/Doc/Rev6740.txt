This isn't necessarily an issue against the handset itself, just a heads-up if you're seeking 
an unlocked and/or international version of the phone.Product was tampered with prior to delivery. KNOX 
counter was tripped, and after breaking "factory seal" stickers, I noticed that an earlier sticker 
had been overlaid with a new one.Signal strength on AT&T is US on LTE bands 
extremely weak as compared to two other phones (iPhone 6 & HTC One M7) when 
sitting side-by-side. Could never get a decent signal even in heart of DC and southern 
MD.Purchased branded AT&T model (SM-G920A) and confirmed much stronger LTE reception.
