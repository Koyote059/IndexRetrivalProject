Had this phone for a year now. Good phone with good battery. I get nearly 
two days on a charge. Have never had low battery anxiety. Sony has done an 
OK job of updating. Marshmallow is nice and im looking forward to nougat. Camera is 
great. Having a camera strap on it is honestly my favorite part. It's so easy 
to get my phone out of my pocket and I never have to worry about 
dropping it. My only dislikes are some minor software issues like no recent apps showing 
from time to time and auto rotate not working sometimes and it taking 5 seconds 
to detect my aux car jack. I hope I get another 2 years out of 
this device because it's still exactly what I want in a phone and Sony's 2016 
Xperia X compact is not even an upgrade.
