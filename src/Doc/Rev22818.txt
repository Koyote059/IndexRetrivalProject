The phone is good as long as you're lucky enough to use it's warranty with 
SAMSUNG in US. The moment there is an issue, this International piece is a burden. 
See what I've received from SAMSUNG US:Thank you for your inquiry. We do apologize for 
any trouble you have encountered in the attempted repair of your product. It has been 
determined that your handset would be what we consider a Parallel Import (PI) product. A 
PI product refers to a product that was initially manufactured for sales purpose in a 
certain country, but then was distributed to another country and sold through unofficial channels such 
as Amazon, eBay, or small offline channels.In other words, your phone was not manufactured and 
distributed through official channels such as service providers or authorized sellers. Typically, Samsung Telecommunications America 
is unable to provide information, technical support or repair service for models manufactured for use 
in other countries as we do not have the components available, therefore, STA is not 
able to provide In-Warranty service.Please see below Samsung Telecommunications America warranty obligations:What is not covered?This 
Limited Warranty is conditioned upon proper use of the Product. This Limited Warranty does not 
cover: (a) defects or damage resulting from accident, misuse, abnormal use, abnormal conditions, improper storage, 
exposure to liquid, moisture, dampness, sand or dirt, neglect, or unusual physical, electrical or electromechanical 
stress; (b) scratches, dents and cosmetic damage, unless caused by SAMSUNG; (c) defects or damage 
resulting from excessive force or use of a metallic object when pressing on a touch 
screen; (d) equipment that has the serial number or the enhancement data code removed, defaced, 
damaged, altered or made illegible; (e) ordinary wear and tear; (f) defects or damage resulting 
from the use of Product in conjunction or connection with accessories, products, or ancillary/peripheral equipment 
not furnished or approved by SAMSUNG; (g) defects or damage resulting from improper testing, operation,

(i) defects or damage resulting from cellular signal reception or transmission, or viruses or other 
software problems introduced into the Product; or (j) Product used or purchased outside the United 
States. This Limited Warranty covers batteries only if battery capacity falls below 80% of rated 
capacity or the battery leaks, and this Limited Warranty does not cover any battery if 
(i) the battery has been charged by a battery charger not specified or approved by 
SAMSUNG for charging the battery; (ii) any of the seals on the battery are broken 
or show evidence of tampering; or (iii) the battery has been used in equipment other 
than the SAMSUNG phone for which it is specified.Although, the handset may have been purchased 
while in the U.S., the phone was not manufactured for use in the U.S. The 
internal components required for repair of international devices are different from those which exist in 
a U.S. device, and Samsung U.S.A does not store inventory for international parts. With that 
stated, Samsung must refer you to Amazon directly for possible resolution to this matter.We do 
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
