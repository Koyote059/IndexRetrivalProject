I bought this phone for my wife thinking it was a good buy I knew 
that the phone was not new needless to say I did not know that the 
phone was so used that the charging port was not working the phone kept overheating 
i bought extra batteries just to keep it working it always shuts off after just 
1 call... these people are frauds they are selling things that are not in GOOD 
WORKING CONDITION ....I want my money back but cant cause the bill was lost, AMAZON 
needs to remove them, I am very disappointed with this buyer...money wasted on a blackberry 
8520 curve that could have gone to another seller..NOTE:if you are looking for a GOOD 
USED reasonable price phone go to Unlocked Cellular Phone store @amazon they are reliable and 
their phones works....As for UnlockedCellPhoneKings they will never never ever get me to purchase any 
thing from them again......Wish I could get a refund back (know I won't) you are 
not trustworthy, your goods are not good, I cannot stress how much I HATE this 
product.People PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS BUYER
