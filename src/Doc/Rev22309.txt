I will preface this by saying that I was waiting for this phone to come 
out for a while and was excited when ASUS decided to make it available to 
the US. I had high expectations going into the purchase and the phone exceeded even 
those! The phone is fast, fluid, and responsive, and battery life is significantly better than 
I expected. I am a medium-range user and it is extremely hard for me to 
run the battery down in a day. Most of the time my phone lasts ~2 
days with 6 hours on-screen time, and is a significant step up over my old 
galaxy S3. I have the $200 version, but even with the 1.8GHz processor current-gen games 
run fine, with occasional spots of fps drops.My only downside is that the phone is 
too big for my tiny hands, making me have to 2-hand stuff a lot of 
the time. It was a big pain point early on but now I am pretty 
used to it. Unfortunately the trend is towards bigger and bigger phones, so I can't 
really fault them on this. Really would've preferred the 5" version they have internationally though.
