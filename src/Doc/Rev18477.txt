I love this phone! It's a good size and weight even if you have smaller 
hands like I do. Nice and quick with neat features like the fingerprint scan and 
Google Apps. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the charging cable 
is USB-C to USB-C, rather than having a USB-A at one end, so I had 
to purchase another cord to use in another charger at work or for connecting it 
to the computer.
