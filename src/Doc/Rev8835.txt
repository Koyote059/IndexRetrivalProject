I've had this phone for almost three months and I love it! I came from 
iPhone 4S and this thing is way better. The software update issue from Huawei is 
not a factor for me so I gave the phone 5 stars.The battery lasts me 
two complete days with regular use. I wake up at 0630 and use the phone 
for texting, calls, random game throughout the day. Then i listen to an audiobook 1+ 
hour via bluetooth in my car while driving home from work. That's my routine for 
two days and i still have 15-20% left at the end of day 2.I haven't 
had one issue with the phone and would highly recommend it.
