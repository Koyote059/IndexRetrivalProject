I am so disappointed! I bought one of these phones and used it for over 
2 years and loved it. When i finally bought an iPhone, I told my husband 
this phone was great. However, when we got this phone. It was in good shape. 
It looked new but the cord that came with it was messed up? When we 
tried to charge the phone it said this cord is not recommended for this phone. 
So we have been trying to make it work. But. Ow the phone won't even 
hold a charge! And now it's too late to return it! Very disappointed!!!
