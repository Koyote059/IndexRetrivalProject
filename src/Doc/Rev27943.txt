While the packaging was in tact, the phone itself was internally damaged and completely nonfunctional. 
It refused to even power up and got stuck on the Apple logo screen. I 
tried several different ways of resolving the problem myself over the course of several hours 
and nothing worked. After contacting Apple, I was told that we had exhausted all the 
options and that there was a hardware problem with the phone. Never even got it 
turned on. Very disappointing- I had very high hopes. I would have ordered a replacement, 
but I didn't want to test my luck again.
