Everything tested? Not so sure about that. Mine was shipped with a loose home button 
and sticky side volume buttons to start. After a month of use the screen is 
starting to come off causing usage errors. Extremely disappointed. I guess that's what I get 
for being cheap and getting "certified" refurbished. I shouldn't have skimp on paying extra $158 
for a brand new one! Lesson learned big time. Now I will have to buy 
a brand new one as this "certified" one has been acting up frequently, afraid it 
will not last much longer. Sad.
