Quick review - overall, I really like this phone, and I imagine that you would 
be *very* hard pressed to find something comparable at this price point.What I like:* It's 
pretty fast compared to my older HTC Evo 4G LTE.* There is very little software 
pre-installed, and as a result, most of the 8GB of internal storage is free.* I 
was able to install all of my apps from the Play Store onto my SD 
card, which means I am not burning up precious internal storage.* The camera is better 
than I expected - it is definitely better than my old HTC, but see my 
dislikes too...* It works great on T-Mobile - 4G LTE speeds!* Sound quality is pretty 
good.* The price - unbeatable.* Comes with a minimalist case and screen protector - great 
call by BLU!* Battery life is pretty good with moderate use - standby time seems 
very good.What I do not like:* There is no LED indicator on this phone! This 
seems like such a minor thing, but I really miss being able to glance at 
my phone and tell if there is a message or email waiting for me. I 
would happily pay another $20 for this feature :)* Build quality seems a bit cheap. 
The T-Mobile guy thought he broke it while trying to put the back cover on 
after installing the SIM card. I think it is not a huge deal at this 
price point, but worth being aware of.* Battery has to come out to install a 
micro SD card.* 1 GB RAM seems to lag occasionally on large apps.* 8 GB 
internal storage is small, but seems to be managed better than on my last phone.* 
The camera is S--L--O--W to focus. Even in normal light, there might be a good 
2 second delay between the time I hit the shutter button and the time I 
hear the annoying beep telling me that I just took a photo. Which leads to...* 
The camera makes a sound every time you take a photo, and I have not 
found a way to disable it. It's not a huge deal I guess, but I 
find it annoying.* The earphones that came with mine are poorly made (but I think 
would sound good if they didn't crackle every time I turn the plug a bit). 
Again, not a huge deal since I have others, but worth noting.It might seem that 
my dislikes outweigh my likes, but I am really pretty happy with this phone. I 
would rate it higher than the Galaxy Avant for what it's worth...
