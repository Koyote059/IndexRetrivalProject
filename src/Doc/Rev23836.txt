I graduated from a simple trac phone to this phone a couple weeks ago. I'm 
still learning learning about it, but am very impressed with what it does. I'm not 
sure if it's a phone that does computer things or a computer that also has 
a phone. It's more than what I need but I'll manage. No need to upgrade 
after you buy this. Nice photos also. Well worth the money.
