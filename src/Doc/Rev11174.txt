I loved this phone. I am a prime member so I got the phone two 
day later after I ordered it. The phone is beautiful, well built. Received the phone 
on friday, set it up and made it mine until Sunday, the day the phone 
went on a bootloop and just died. Thankfully I purchase most of my items from 
Amazon, so returning the phone wasn't a big deal. Know this: If you purchase this 
phone new it will probably give you 8 months until it croaks. However if you 
purchase it used you really don't know how much time you have. It could be 
hours, days, or weeks. But know this: it will eventually bootloop on you. This is 
a manufacturer defect that is all over the internet about this phone. I didn't do 
my research before purchasing the phone. So, future buyers, beware!
