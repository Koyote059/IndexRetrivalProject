There is a known issue with the phone regarding it not reading the SIM card. 
The card slides in smoothly, but rather than clicking into place as you would expect, 
the spring pushes the card right back out again. BTW you will need to purchase 
a Micro Sim card because the SG2 SIM card is not compatible (too big). Here 
is another review with the exact same problem ~ Question Samsung Galaxy S3 - SIM 
Card Problems... Hello again Howard forum, I have just received my SGS3 earlier today, and 
until now I just love it.. My problem is, I have a Micro Sim card, 
wich won't go in my device.. Whenever I put it in, it slides up a 
few mm, and, therefore, it won't work in the mobile. I have pulled it in 
and out 100 times now, and it just won't get in place. It has to 
get in place, where you can push it down once, and it should pop out, 
but I can't get it to do that, as I can't get the sim to 
fit down in there. To get the sim out I have to use a knife, 
needle or something else with a small sharp point to push it out with.. So 
the phone is not 'working', and I can't text or anything.. What would you suggest 
me to do, as I am pretty confused right now.. :-(
