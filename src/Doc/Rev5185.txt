I used my first Nokia 6250 for almost five years. My husband and I looked 
at the new iPhone but I could barely read the fine print on the small 
screen. I do not eMail, text, surf the internet or listen to music on a 
phone so do not want a data plan, just a simple phone that can hold 
my address book.My husband was in an ICU when the my first Nokia 6250 finally 
had to be replaced. I put the sim card into my husband's Blackberri and used 
it for a frustrating six weeks: The tiny keys were difficult for my arthritic fingers 
to use, it was not nearly as comfortable to hold as the Nokia, and I'd 
never use most of it's features. I finally gave up on it and found this 
phone on Amazon.I'm again happy to have a phone that meets my simple communication needs, 
is comfortable in my hand and easy to use. I then purchased a mini iPad 
with a data plan. It is SO much easier to read and use than the 
"smart phones, and it easily slips into my purse. For me, this is the best 
of both worlds!
