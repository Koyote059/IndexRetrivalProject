I experienced the same problem as other reviewers:1. The ear piece plug hole does not 
line up with the earplug jack on the iPhone 6... this must be a irregular 
unit2. The touch part of the iPhone has been rendered ineffective due to the thick 
nature of the front cover...3. the silence switch is near impossible to get to. For 
people who has larger hands, it will be impossibleThe box seems sturdy but adds a 
lot of weight.
