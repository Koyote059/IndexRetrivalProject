I had this phone for my grandma and by the 2nd month everything started to 
break. Call quality dropped. The screen stopped working. Phone started to fall apart. Crap phone 
for $50. If I knew I would've bought a phone from ebay for $20 and 
still work. I thought because it was amazon the phone would be great but it 
isn't.Not worth the money especially for $50.
