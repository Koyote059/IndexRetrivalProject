This is the first time I bought a refurbished iphone and my last one. I 
regret buying this phone big time!Fully charged battery will just run for 15mins after less 
than 3 months of use! Home button started acting up, and power button won't work.If 
you are buying a refurbished phone, it's like a box of chocolates. You never know 
what you're gonna get!To sum it all up, it's like a gamble with your $400, 
just get a used phone from someone you know personally or a friend. Also a 
better option would be, a promo deal with phone company providers or get an installment 
deal with Apple Store. Never a refurbished phone.
