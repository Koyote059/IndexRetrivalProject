This phone is not unlocked as may think it is. I called T-Mobile and it 
does not help to unlock. The same with Samsung. They say since they cannot verify 
the ownership of the phone they do not help to unlock it. They send back 
to Amazon. What a mess!!! I thought I was buying an unlocked phone. Too bad 
for me...
