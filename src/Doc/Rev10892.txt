I bought this phone as a gift for someone not very familiar with smartphones; I 
knew it was a cheap device so I did not expect fancy screens or impressive 
features, but I thought it would make a good entry-level phone.The phone is good looking 
and nicely packed, and it was relatively easy to use. Not too bad for the 
price.The downside, it died after 6 months of very light use. We turned the phone 
off and left it charging during the night, by morning the device was super-hot and 
would not turn on. We let it cool down, tried again several times with no 
luck, removed the battery, tried charging again, you name it. No luck at all.The phone 
is officialy a papaer weight now....
