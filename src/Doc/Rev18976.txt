Got this like a week ago. I bought the XPERIA Z3 6603 and works perfectly 
with ATT and gets LTE. No bloatware or anything from Tmobile like I've read in 
other reviews. First thing it did when i turned it on was download the new 
version of android (lollipop) so that was awesome. Love it! Everybody asks about my phone. 
Plus i added a 64 sd to it. Only bad thing is that they don't 
add the plug in adapter for the charger. It comes with the international one that 
doesn't work in the states. It came with a screen protector and one for the 
backside as well.
