I specifically asked the supplier before buying that the Doro cellphone was "unlocked" and able 
to be used in New Zealand on another network but Vodafone NZ tell me that 
although they have transferred my existing SIM card to the Doro cellphone , I have 
to get Consumer Cellular in the US to tell me if I can activate the 
phone. I have e mailed them to ask their advice but I did not expect 
to have to do this and it is very disappointing.The mailing charges were high and 
if I have to return product, would expect a full refund.
