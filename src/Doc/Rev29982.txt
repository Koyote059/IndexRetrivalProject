From the start it looked nice. I thought it would be great to get a 
cheap smart watch because I didn't want to spend hundreds on one. It started getting 
bad once I got into it. You are stuck with only three clock options that 
you can't change at all and they are all ugly. The function if the watch 
is slow and never clicks where I want it to. There where no directions with 
mine so I had to google how to setit up.Also in the description it says 
all this cool stuff you can do, like stream music through your phone to the 
watch but that's not true. 90% of what it says it can do you need 
to insert a separate SIM card for the watch itself. There is no internal storage 
at all so if you want to store anything you HAVE to have a micro 
SD. You can not delete or add any apps to the watch so if you 
don't put in the SIM card you will have a bunch of apps that you 
can't use. You can get notifications from your phone on the watch but it has 
terrible settings. You would expect that it would have ring, vibrate, vibrate and ring, and 
silent. But no they put idiotic names for them for example "outside" has it be 
ring and vibrate. And "meeting" is just vibrate. Speaking of vibrate it is terrible. I 
swear it is louder than the sound. So much stuff moves around in it if 
you where sitting in class or a meeting and that went off everyone will be 
looking at you.Overall this watch is garbage and I am returning mine and will be 
looking somewhere else for a smart watch
