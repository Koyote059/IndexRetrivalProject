I bought this phone as a gift for my friend in Russia. My own phone 
(LG) cost me $100 and it's great! So the price and the features of ALCATEL 
OneTouch Pop 3 Global Unlocked 4G satisfied me too.First of all I didn't like both 
cameras. I'm into photography, I DO know how 5MP and 2MP pictures look like. So 
the front camera is not even remotely close to 2MP (probably 0.3 or MAX 1MP). 
The main camera is not that bad but pics come out A LITTLE BIT worse 
than 5MP. Even though I set both cameras to the highest quality.Well it's okay. Not 
a big deal... I guess.What has REALLY disappointed me is language settings!!! Yes, this phone 
has a keyboard in (I guess) any language. You can type in EN, Russian, German 
etc. BUT there are only FOUR languages available to set as the main language. The 
phone's menu can be in English, French, Spanish or Italian ONLY. Tha'ts it! I understand 
that English is an international language but not everyone speaks English! My friend in Russia 
doesn't! Even my own phone has a bunch of languages including Russian.The menu, apps, notifications 
are in EN.I spent all day searching for any apps or drivers that could help 
me to add more languages. Nothing! Btw there are no official drivers for this phone. 
When I hooked up it to my computer it showed me that it had its 
own drivers. I clicked "install" and NOTHING happened.I am still going to send it to 
my friend but if only we find out it is not GSM unlocked I will 
get it back to the US and return to Amazon. I just have a hard 
time to believe the features that the company has claimed.P.s. I am actually returning this 
product because I do not trust its description. I don't want to risk and spend 
more money.
