It glitches a bit but it's still kind of usable. Because it's a unlocked phone 
and not made with T-mobile and I have the T-mobile network, it won't update and 
because of that the lockscreen button doest work. I'm going to have to get a 
new phone. But Im sure this isn't the sellers fault, this may be something that 
you must risk when buying an unlocked phone.
