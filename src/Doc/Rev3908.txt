I got the phone yesterday ,everything was looking fine...i trough i made a good deal 
after all but not even a couple of hours the screen went black and when 
i tried to turn it on i got only a green stripe on the left 
side,it seems the display is defect . I returned the product right away . From 
my personal experience , don't buy refurbished products especially when you pay so much for 
a phone , put a little bit more and buy it new. Now i have 
to returnt it and wait for my refund and that's just a waste of time. 
Thanks god it started to show off the defects before was too late
