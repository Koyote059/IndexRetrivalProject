Please do not buy this phone from this seller. Phone is defective after less than 
a month of using itI purchased two phones and I'm stuck with them. It has 
problems charging and I have used and bought several charges to use it still does 
not recognize its been charged. The charging space on the phone is defective and that 
means I cant use phone and I just threw $150 away. I am angry that 
the seller does not offer any warranty for a phone. Please save your money don't 
buy this phone from this seller.
