It's a nice phone it looks very pretty and has nice quality for the price 
but the things that took away the 2 stars for the phone is the battery 
is at the low end for the type of specs it has it's a octa 
core which heats up quickly while using 4g and it drains the battery very quick 
too even with the battery saving feature 2300mah just isn't enough for this type of 
phone. The other thing that also took off some points is the sound card the 
phone has the volume bar is ridiculous in some phone you can barely go half 
way and you can hear the music clearly but in this one you have to 
go all the way to have good sound and i'm using sennheiser hd 449 so 
it should be better honestly if I could go back and choose what phone to 
go get I would go check either xiaomi or meizu phones they look better and 
are cheaper with better quality built and good soundcards with bigger batteries
