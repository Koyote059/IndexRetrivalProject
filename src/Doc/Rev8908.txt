They did not explain that you will have a lot of trouble trying to activate 
and get ride of the"activation required".It is just not simple for those who just want 
to plug their sim card and start their phone.I have just learnt a lesson which 
is to pay the most to get the best,never again.I will buy me an Iphone 
5 and get peace of mind.There is no wonder Blackberry is dying because of those 
many little complication to use their phones.It sucks.I will donate this one to charity but 
you have to tell your customer that your phones are not that unlocked and they 
need to go through a long process that can lead them to spend another sum 
of money.
