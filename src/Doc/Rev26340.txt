Crisp pictures, love the access to apps, clear phone calls, the size is comfortable, i 
even like the predictive text and i've always hated that feature on other phones.I do 
not like the headphones, they hurt my ears and allow too much background noise in, 
so the the volume available does not compensate for that factor.I got better sound quality 
from my much older sony ericcson
