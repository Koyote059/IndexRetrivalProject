The internet reviews for this phone looked really good and so as my Blackberry was 
dying I decided to purchase one. Firstly it did not arrive by the guaranteed shipping 
date. It arrived 5 days later. I originally had it shipped to a friend's house 
but because it arrived 5 days late, he had left the country. So we had 
to convince the FedEx guy to allow the neighbour to sign for it then ship 
it to a new address, which had an additional cost attached to it. When I 
finally got the phone and opened it up, the manual was missing from the box 
- maybe it was a used phone. When I finally loaded my SIM card and 
made the first call I realized the microphone was not working. Anyone interested in purchasing 
this phone, search for forums about "microphone not working in Lumia 920" on the internet. 
Unfortunately I did not pick up on this earlier, the microphone has a noise reduction 
feature which sometimes cancels out your voice completely so the person on the other end 
does not hear you at all. Sure it works fine on speaker and videocam because 
that uses a different microphone. Apparently it is a design flaw in the Lumia 920 
and Nokia doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. All those fancy features yet 
the basic thing a phone is supposed to be able to do is allow you 
to make and receive calls and the Lumia 920 is incapable of doing that. What 
a waste of money! Disappointed!
