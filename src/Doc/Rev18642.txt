This phone is wonderful. It has fast WiFi speeds and good mobile data speeds. On 
T-Mobile in US I only get H+, H, 3G, E and G. If I'm lucky 
I can get 4G sometimes. This phone is the International Version so some LTE bands 
won't work for US. The camera on this phone is great. If I hold the 
phone still when I take the picture then it would turn out really well. Though 
this phone has a fingerprint sensor, it sometimes doesn't register the fingerprint and after a 
while I give up and put in my alternative password. The touchscreen is great and 
responds really well. Out of the box it is running Android 4.4.2 KitKat which is 
really fast. On certain apps the phone crashes and restarts or it just freezes and 
you have to take the battery out and put it back in. Since this version 
is the International Version it does have NFC unlike the US Version. Calling is great 
and you can hear the person you're talking to really clearly. Also in the box 
it comes with the phone, a battery, earbuds with microphone and volume controls, and a 
USB Charger that has to long round ports and can only be used internationally.Overall, this 
is an excellent phone and works really well. If you're looking for a phone that 
isn't very expensive and can get the job done then this is the phone you're 
looking for. The screen is not too big and not too small. You can easily 
use the phone with one hand and reach all four corners. I really recommend this 
phone!
