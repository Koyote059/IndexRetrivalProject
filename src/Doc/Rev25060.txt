Beautiful phone. arrived in full retail packaging, factory reset. flawless condition.. Brand new.Shipped via prime 
and arrived on time. Inserted sim card and I was up and running. The screen 
itself is gorgeous, but not very bright. battery life is downright poor. Camera is pretty 
good... I like the way Sonys take photographs.Sound too is a plus. Many reviews speak 
about speaker quality. I for one rarely use the external speakers... I use Bluetooth all 
the time. I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge and found the edge attenuated 
Bluetooth too much. Sonys Bluetooth streaming is strong and rich. ClearBass does a superior job 
in delivering sound to my listening devices.The fingerprint scanner is also far superior to the 
edge in terms of placement, speed and accuracy.The seller delivered on the product.
