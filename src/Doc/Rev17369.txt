This phone is OK...but no boomsound front facing speakers, so the terribly places speaker grill 
will be covered by your pinky finger while holding with one hand, which will muffle 
the already disappointingly low volume. The volume sucks. It has boomsound, but only when done 
headphones are plugged in. The screen is nice, everything else is solid. The camera is 
improved over the M9, but the M9 is overall a better phone. This phone is 
OK If u want an Android in an iPhone's body.
