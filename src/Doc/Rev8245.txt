LG V10 H962. I've only had this phone for a week. Here are the pros 
and cons so far.Pro.1. Replaceable battery.2. Upgradeable storage.3, Unlocked phone, dual sim slots.Con.1. No LTE 
Service in the US. This phone does not support the necessary channels for LTE service 
in the US. Not with ATT, T-mobile, Sprint, Verizon or any other US carrier that 
I am aware of. It does support voice ,GSM and 3G data services with ATT.Overall, 
I wish I could get LTE connectivity with my phone but with my usage patterns 
I wouldn't benefit from the additional bandwidth anyway. For my use the flexibility of having 
an unlocked phone with upgradeable storage and replaceable battery far outweigh the lack of LTE 
service.I would purchase again.
