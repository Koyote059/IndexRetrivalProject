I absolutely LOVE my BLU phone. It's been a year and the phone has the 
best battery life than any mobile device I've had, including my BlackBerry. I initially had 
two other BLU phones (including the big 6" one, which I totally hate). The other 
was the BLU Advance 4.0 Unlocked Dual SIM Cellphone. Both had HORRIBLE battery drain. STAY 
AWAY AT ALL COSTS. But the Energy is a winner. I can charge my phone 
and it stays charged for several days, provided I don't spend extended time on the 
internet. But if your phone is primarily used for talking - like it should be 
used - and you have other means of using the internet, the batter life of 
this phone usually lasts me 6-7 days on one charge. Great buy for the price.
