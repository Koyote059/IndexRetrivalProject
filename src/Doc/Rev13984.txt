The phone I received was US991 model with Android 5.1 (Lollipop) and security patch level 
2016-03-01. I though OK, let me go ahead and update... What? No update available!!! Having 
a brand new phone with the base OS two major levels below the current one 
and an outdated security patch level was not something I really wanted. Now I see 
that others here complained about not being able to update to Marshmallow, so I guess 
I'm not the only unlucky one. I don't know about you guys, but I'm returning 
the phone. Thank you Amazon Prime!
