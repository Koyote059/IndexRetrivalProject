phone didn't have the features I was used to when I first bought the s4 
when it came out through my wireless provider.... maybe it has the newer/worst update; the 
jellybean software. And the phone would frequently (ave 1x/day) say it didn't recognize my tmobil 
sim and need to restart. It would work fine after the restart.... until the next 
time which could be a week or a couple hours. for the price, not a 
bad phone.
