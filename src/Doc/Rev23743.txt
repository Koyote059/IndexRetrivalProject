I even keep the back piece attached when it's in my pocket. I have had 
Otterbox defenders on several of my cell phones. These are sturdy and even with the 
back attached it will still fit in my shirt pocket of my dress shirts. This 
one is much prettier than others I've had and my phone is thus distinctive. I 
can't understand why people have black cases on black cell phones that look like everybody 
else's cell phones. Same as the stupidity of traveling with a black suitcase. Mine are 
Maroon.
