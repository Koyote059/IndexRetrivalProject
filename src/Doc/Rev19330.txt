Device came inside an opened box! and it has a Telstra's prepaid plan, it comes 
with Telstra's SIM card so it doesn't work with any other carrier! this device appears 
listed under unlocked cellphones in amazon's website, filled a claim and amazon stood by the 
seller, what a shame! you can see the picture under customer images
