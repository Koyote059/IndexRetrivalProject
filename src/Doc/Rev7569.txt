I bought this phone in July 12 2016 for a gift to a cousin , 
well my cousin received his phone this week ( 25 August ) and Now the 
phone does not turn on , the battery does not work with your charger and 
try to load it with a universal charger and battery overheats, as a new phone 
may not work ??? I don't understand
