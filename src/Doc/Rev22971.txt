Like I image most other US consumers, I had never heard of the Huawei brand 
before this phone. However, a quick Google search reveals it's the 3rd largest smartphone maker 
behind Apple and Samsung.The build quality on the phone is top notch. It feels substantial 
and fits nicely in your hand. The back case is a fingerprint magnet, but it 
looks beautiful! As you can see in the pictures I posted, it is almost the 
same size of an iPhone 6.I also like how Huawei hasn't added a lot of 
proprietary software or changed the Android OS much. One of the most interesting features is 
the dual rear cameras. It takes great photos, but I'll need to play with it 
more to really see the differences in the picture quality. I'll try to come back 
and update it after spending more time with it.So far I'm really enjoying using the 
Honor 8, and it is a lot of phone for the money. It is an 
excellent option for those who want an unlocked device.
