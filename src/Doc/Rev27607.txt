Worked really well for a few months. Now the sound only works if it is 
on speaker phone. At this point I only really use it to access the internet 
and messenger. For this function it is good. For phone calls and skype it is 
nearly worthless. Especially skype or any app like snap chat it loads too slow. All 
videos are very pixalated. Even when I send them. Camera is also pretty crappy compared 
to other phones I have had. (Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy3) Now that the memory is 
almost already full (in only 6 monthes) I have to restart it A LOT, apps 
crash a lot/ freeze and the camera has problems. I only purchased because I am 
living out of the country and wanted a cheap phone that I don't have to 
insure. For that purpose I believe it has met my expectations. Also can hold two 
sim cards which is very nice as I travel back and forth and need to 
switch carriers. Compared to cost of other phones that i have had before and comparing 
it's processing to it is good value. 1/5th of the price!!!! The appearance is very 
nice. Even the guy in the cell phone store thought it was an iphone 6. 
Also very durable and comes with a screen protector and case which is convenient and 
saves money. Battery life is good. I charge every night even though it never gets 
below 50% (unless I'm using constantly all day), also charges fairly fast.Don't get it you 
are expecting it to act like a $400 phone. I think it would be a 
GREAT fit for 1st time smart phone owners.
