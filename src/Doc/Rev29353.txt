Warning: this 2008 version of the Sidekick is no longer compatible with current TMobile services 
as of March, 2012!! Incoming calls and caller ID's worked, but texting (sound notifications and 
contact names) services did not work for us. After a couple of hours in our 
local TMobile store, we were informed that the manufacturer of this phone acknowledged a problem 
with these exact areas with this version of their phone, and there is NO remedy 
for this problem. I am attempting to return this phone to Amazon ASAP.
