Represented as certified refurbished. The cable(slightly shorter) and charger are not original.Most importantly, the charger 
has no test lab approval markings. Various companies conduct tests for quality and safety. Although 
test lab approval may not be required by law, many local agencies frown on non 
approved products and may prohibit their use especially in schools and hospitals. Better manufacturers submit 
their products for testing and evaluation approvals which can be lengthy and very expensive.I suppose 
if I asked the manufacturer for support regarding charging issues, their first question would likely 
be, "Are you using an original charger?"If I were the manufacturer of the phone, I 
would be very concerned about the substituting of the original charger with charger not bearing 
an approval from one of the test labs.
