Don't waste your money buying this phone. Is a bad bad phone. I received 3 
weeks ago and the micro SD never work it. I tried with 3 differents micro 
SD also with differents brands and never work it. I just let work like this, 
but this morning the lcd was broken. Every night I put the phone in the 
table, before to asleep, and this morning when I woke up and checked-in the phone 
the lcd screen was broken just like this... The phone never felt, never push, never 
took or pain with other objects... Is a worst phone that I had it. I 
want my money back.You could see in the pictures that the phone even doesn't have 
any scratches or something. The lcd screen just broke up like this... No reason.
