I can say that the product is just great. It's a fantastic android phone. Many 
would doubt about purchasing a phone so cheap, but this is just one of the 
strongest points as well, considering that it has been selected as the phone of the 
2014 year. It also doesn't deviate much from the standard android, and was one of 
the first ones to receive the new lollipop version upgrade, and it works really great.My 
previous phone was a galaxy s3 and was really happy with the Samsung style and 
wasn't sure about changing to a more standard android style, as well as the main 
button bar. After using it for just a week I can say that it feels 
really comfortable. Phone is a little bigger, but not huge, size is just great and 
red color makes it look really cool.My only complain is with the seller as in 
the details descriptions it is mentioned to be the 3gb ram version, but it's the 
2nd. The other colors showed in fact that they were the 2 go version, and 
the red one just mentioned to be the 3 go version, which weighted on my 
final decision for the red version. Hope this is clarified for future customers.
