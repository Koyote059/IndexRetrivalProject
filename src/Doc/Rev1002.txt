This was a gift to my son and he has loved it from the moment 
he received it. He's currently taking college classes in Cincinnati and it allows him to 
stay in touch with family and friends.My son loves Apple products and enjoys listening to 
downloaded music on his new Apple iPhone 3GS and the 16 GB gives him enought 
space to keep a nice library of music.I would recommand Amazon to everyone that is 
looking for a replacement or new smart phone
