I was definitely scared to buy a phone online, but it was completely legit. Came 
with headphones and a charger. Brand new. The screen has always had a little defect 
though. I don't blame this at all on the shipper though. The screen has always 
been a little u calibrated when a case is on my phone. But I bought 
this phone almost a year ago and still does what I want it to.
