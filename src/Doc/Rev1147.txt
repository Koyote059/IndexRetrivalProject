This is perhaps the best smart phone you can get at this price point. the 
build is sturdy and no matter how many times it falls, you expect a nokia 
to take that!Edit: Appless phonethe phone itself is great. does what you can expect out 
of it. but there are NO APPs. do yourself a favor and get droid. after 
using this phone for a couple of months i am really disappointed that there are 
no basic apps in the symbian world. really sad :-(
