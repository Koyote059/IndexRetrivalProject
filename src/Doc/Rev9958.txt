Previously I had an iPhone4 and I didn't want to spend that much money again. 
I got this phone on CyberMonday 1yr and a half ago for $190 and it's 
still working fine. It worked in the US (where I got it) and it's working 
in Australia. Didn't put a SIM card in Europe.3 things that need to be fixed:- 
no OS update available since purchase. I can't download some apps because of this.- can't 
navigate with offline maps because GPS won't locate me apparently- when recording, there is a 
background noise so every video is disturbed, sometimes vocal messages are just plain noise and 
I have to restart the phone, so it's a software and not hardware problem but, 
then again, no updates available and I don't feel like stressing to fix it.Would still 
strongly recommend it.
