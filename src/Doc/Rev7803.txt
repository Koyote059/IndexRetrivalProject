Its small so easy to fit in a purse or in your pockets. I can 
listen to the radio and save my favorite stations. The only things I would say 
is a little problem is that you can only receive 300 MB (as pictures goes) 
nothing over that number wouldn't be able to download. And you also have to re-size 
picture that you've taken to send to individual. You can't text while in a conversation 
with someone or surf the net, kinda weird but that's how the phone operate. Oh 
yeah and you would have to delete text that someone sent along the way since 
the memory is very little for the phone.
