bought it for myself. pros: good screen size/display and camera; Nokia off-line map is a 
plus, but it is not as powerful as google map yet with data plan; Large 
icons are easy to use.cons: the biggest problem is the efficiency/battery duration. programs and games 
are rather limited, and some of them basically burn the phone very hot though you 
put them in the background; at least a couple of times the battery died arund 
3 or 4 pm in the afternoon; recharging seems to be slow; if I forget 
to put on charge overnight, it is guaranteed to run of battery in the morning 
and you'd better not completely rely it for the wake-up call in the morning! The 
screen is not as strong as I hoped, and I already have several scratches.
