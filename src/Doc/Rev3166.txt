EDIT: I've had some problems with the screen becoming disconnected from the rest of the 
phone which makes it turn off randomly at some times. I've had to take it 
to get it fixed, which cost about $65 and I'm disappointed because besides that it 
has been working fine. I'm having the same problem again now, possibly due to me 
dropping it (whoops) but I wish there was a way I could get it fixed 
for free through a warranty.--------------------The unlocked Galaxy S5 works like new! I'm able to use 
Tracfone with it which saves me a lot of money. So far I haven't had 
any problems with it, although the only small complaint that I have is that the 
charger port cover does not snap in properly, but it can still stay closed so 
it's not really a problem. Overall I'd definitely recommend this!!
