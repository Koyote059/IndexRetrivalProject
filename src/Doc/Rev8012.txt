I bought it in view of my international travel and to have an experience of 
3G phone.But it did not work in India!I am totally disappointed! I may never attempt 
to buy phones online, especially NOKIA!Though it is mentioned as Nokia E71, it has another 
number besides written in small fine print!Though I took it to the Nokia service center 
for reformating and they charged Rs 310, it was useless. Looks like they took the 
money and did nothing!!I lost my opinion about the Nokia Customer care as well!I wonder 
why they call it unlocked, when it is locked to North America!
