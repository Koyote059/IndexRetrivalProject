Believe it or not I actually sold my HTC smart phone and replaced it with 
KRZR K1. All I wanted was a reliable phone to make calls and send the 
occasional txt. The KRZR K1 fills those shoes beautifully. It's small (fits in my pocket) 
& the sound quality and features are above average. It's unbelievable that a "Flip Phone" 
is now considered old school in the sea of ever expanding smart phones.
