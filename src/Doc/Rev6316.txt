These have defective memory chips. These 16gb note 2 have defective memory chips that cause 
Samsung sudden death. Look up insane chips. Samsung will not fix it. They will not 
help at all. There is a company that will replace the emmc chip for $150. 
I've used this phone for about 8 months now and it's been very difficult to 
keep it working. It crashes and the screen will not come back on. Many people 
who purchased these 16gb gt-n7100 have had complete device failures. Samsung does not service these 
phones and will not help...they directed me to the Phillipines, UK, and India. The UK 
said they can't help because it's a USA variant....it's been a nightmare. Notice that a 
lot of the 5 star reviews are not labeled verified purchases...
