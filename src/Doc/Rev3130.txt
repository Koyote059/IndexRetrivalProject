Good for $100 but has no gyro for VR/Google Cardboard, etc. Camera works well.BAD: On 
my unit the backlight (or some kind of light) is way too visible and ruins 
the display in that one (pea-sized) area (lower left of screen in portrait mode about 
an inch in). When I called BLU they wanted me to take a picture of 
it and acted like it was my fault. Other issues: the volume control is pretty 
much loud to louder and you can't set a low volume on it - that 
is, when the UI shows the smallest setting (it's a discrete position) it is about 
50% loud instead of 5%. It's like the designers don't know about logarithms or ?!#$@?! 
Not a lot of room for programs, but does hold the basics.GOOD: The camera quality 
is excellent - both front and back. The screen is still clear with no scratches 
after being used for six months - quality glass - and I'm not even using 
a screen protector. It's beautiful. Size is good. Back cover is good. Orange color is... 
well, unique... not easy to lose. It works with H2OWireless. The external memory slot is 
very useful, just requires a bit of hassle to move as much as you can 
to use the SIM. Battery life is very good compared to my earlier mini-S4 (lost 
down the highway - really).OVERALL: Good value, I think, but I'd like BLU to be 
a bit more proactive on the quality control issues (mentioned above) and the audio. I've 
yet to find a phone that doesn't cost a fortune to do what this one 
does for the money, so, I'm giving it a 3.5 (rounds up to 4) but 
it's really an "okay plus".
