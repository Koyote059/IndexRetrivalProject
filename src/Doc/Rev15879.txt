I took this phone to two different Verizon stores, and they were unable to activate 
it. I am very grateful for Amazon's return policy, when I took action to return 
it a shipping label (i.e., free return shipping) was provided to me and once the 
phone was returned, I received a refund for the cost of the phone as well 
as the shipping costs.Because I was still phone-less when this phone would not activate, I 
went to a phone repair shop and picked up a similar phone for a similar 
price. If you have lost or broken your phone and need a replacement, I recommend 
you check out the local phone repair shops first - they may have a temporary 
solution until you are eligible for an upgrade.
