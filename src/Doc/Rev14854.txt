Phone was advertised as a sprint phone. No where was it indicated that the specific 
phone we received had previously been on a PRE-PAID contract and therefore not able to 
ever be added to a standard line of service - Sprint or otherwise. Spent way 
too much time on the phone with Sprint as well as driving quite a distance 
to a retail location only to find out the phone is useless.
