I recently purchased the ZTE Axon 7 and had it for about a week. First 
off the phone itself is solid. 4GB of Memory, 64GB of storage + expandable storage, 
dual sim card, solid speaker system, finger print reader, etc. The list goes on honestly.The 
big issues I had was being with Verizon they are not too kind to unlocked 
devices. Now to be clear if you are with Verizon the phone itself will work 
on the network with your nano sim inserted, however, it registers as roaming and will 
not always have the best service as if you were on "regular" verizon phone. If 
verizon flips the switch to allow the ZTE Axon 7 to "work" on the network 
I would gladly keep the ZTE, but until then I have to switch back to 
a verizon compatible phone.
