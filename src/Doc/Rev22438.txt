I used this phone for a few months. It looked good and the physical keyboard 
was very useful. Unfortunately the phone (OS) crashed very often what became extremely annoying. After 
the OS crash you have to remove the battery and restart the system. Once I 
overslept and was late to work just because the system froze in the night and 
the alarm didn't ring in the morning.What is really unbelievable is the fact there is 
no firmware update available for this model. It just shows how much LG cares about 
the functionality and reliability of their devices and customers' satisfaction. I dumped this phone and 
got myself a cool new Android handset which most importantly just works. I'm very disappointed 
with LG and will stay away from their products. I sincerely advise you the same.
