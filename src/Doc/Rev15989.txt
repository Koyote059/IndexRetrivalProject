I bought this phone for my parents and it is such an upgrade from their 
old chunky phone. The 5 inch screen size is a good size for them and 
the phone itself is relatively fast. I got it for $50 and for the price 
paid it is a very nice looking phone and does not look cheap at all, 
but quite sturdy! If you do lots of heavy browsing or play lots of phone 
games, I don't think this phone will hold up greatly, but if you are like 
my parents and just use it for talking, texting, and the occasional Google Maps, it 
is worth it.
