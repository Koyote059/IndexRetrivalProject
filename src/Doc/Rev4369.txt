I am loving this phone. I don't know if the extra 2gb of ram was 
really necessary but I tend to load my phone up with tons of apps and 
the relatively huge storage is serving me nicely. I am using ~ 18gb out of 
64 and have barely touched the SD card I added.The UI has been snappy and 
overall the phone seems very responsive.I have had a few glitches where the home button 
seemed to go crazy and act like I kept pressing it, but that seems to 
have cleared up.I am using this phone on Verizon and hope to try a prepaid 
MVNO on AT&T towers to see who has the best reception in our rural area. 
On Verizon reception seems to be good.
