This phone has very poor reception, so I have to use headphones when speaking on 
it. I thought because it is a Polaroid phone my pictures would be great and 
boy was I wrong, the resolution in bad as well and all pictures come out 
as blurred. This is not a phone to take a quick picture, one would have 
to hold the phone steady for about 60 seconds to get a decent shoot. I 
wanted to return it, but my 30 day return time ran out, so I am 
stuck with it. One more thing it was a friend of mind who bought the 
6 inch version that does no longer charges, my friend has to take out the 
battery to charge....that will be the last time I take advice from a friend on 
buying a phone. The only good thing for me is that the phone came unlocked 
and with a clear soft case. Don't buy this phone.
