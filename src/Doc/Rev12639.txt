I've been using Otterbox defenders since the iPhone 3Gs. This is the worst one EVER!!! 
The screen protector doesn't fit exactly and so it's not flush against the screen. Which 
is very annoying. You will miss letters or hit the wrong letters when typing. And 
the new feature of 3D Touch on the new iphone6 is pretty much rendered useless 
with this case. I'm so disappointed. So I've return it and ordered this one instead(only 
because it had reviews that it's identical to an Otterbox). And it really is."Fogeek PC 
TPU Combo Protective case for IPhone 6 Plus & 6s plus". I've typed all this 
review with the cover on and zero problems. Plus it's 12.99$ with prime shipping(bonus).
