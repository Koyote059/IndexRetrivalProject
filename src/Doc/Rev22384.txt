S7 Edge from United Arab Emirates (its what the phone detials say in the settings). 
Was brand new and unopened. Works perfectly. Setting it up was as easy as popping 
a nano sim card in. Was worried something might be faulty but the processor is 
snappy, screen is perfect as is the camera. No faults what so ever. Ordered Sept. 
28 and arrived Oct 1st. I would highly recommend as there is no bloatware and 
it has a faster processor than US version. Have not tested the waterproof feature to 
give feedback on that.Seller: Wireless Everything
