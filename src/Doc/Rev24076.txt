I change phone company and I couldn't use my old phone.I phone it's not much 
of a phone without apps, galaxy it's ok, but Nokia has always been my choice.I 
choose Lumia 920.Works with every SIM card. 4G, great antena reception.It says AT&T but it's 
International unlocked, meaning that I have used it with Mexican Movistar, Mexican Telcel and AT&T 
in the US.Simply until now, the best phone.
