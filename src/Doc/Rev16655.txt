**SEE UPDATE BELOW**I've been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so 
glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or 
long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don't notice any heat during 
typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn't be considered 
one of the strengths of this phone. I don't imagine battery life gets any better 
with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at 
this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That 
said, I haven't experimented too much with "stamina mode" but if you use alternate messaging 
services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you'll have to add those 
apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will 
diminish the benefit of "stamina mode" and preclude you from using "ultra stamina mode" all 
together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I'm very impressed with how 
much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while 
(ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would've been nice to have but I'll gladly sacrifice that 
feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. 
My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and 
was bummed he couldn't get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn't have 
an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was 
able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my 
phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don't know why we are letting 
phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality 
looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan 
on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent 
eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don't take 
a lot of photos / videos but I'm pleased with the camera so far. You 
can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but 
Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step 
up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a 
big fan of HTC's Sense UI and didn't know how I'd like Sony's UI as 
this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather 
widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and 
fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far 
as I know the perfect phone doesn't exist but based on the other flagship phones 
available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was 
prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 however because 
it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising "soon" updates 
to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but 
then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while 
the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I'll adjust 
my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time 
to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I've 
ever had. On paper it's great but I've never been so frustrated with lagging issue. 
I'll get a phone call while its in my hand and I'll mis the call 
because pushing "answer" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting 
the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now 
March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. 
Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I'll get it 
if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems.
