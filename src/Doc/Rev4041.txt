Amazon warehouse iPhone 4 for my wife cost less than my iPhone 4 purchased through 
Craigslist.The Amazon iPhone 4 was in better condition and a better $value than what I 
had purchased through Craigslist.Although the Craigslist iPhone OS software was already upgraded to 6.01, a 
major software upgrade requiringa complete re-install of all software APPS, iCloud, and Facetime.Amazon iPhone came 
with OS 4.2 operating system requiring that I perform the complete software upgrade, APPS,and settings 
reinstall myself, thus the 4 Star rating.If Amazon perform the OS software upgrades, I would 
have given them a 5 Star rating.
