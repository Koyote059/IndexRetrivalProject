Garbage! Stay away. Work for like 5 months. Lcd stop working. I had to pay 
10 dollars and one week without phone to send to alcatel.Two months later power button 
stop working. Physically its fine but i guess electrical;y no. Just terrible quality control or 
just super cheap parts.Do not waste your money. Ive read at least another 100 reviews 
same issues in less than 1 year for a phone in meticulus condition in a 
bomb proof case the entire time. Thank god i have a moto g 3 as 
a backup i bought used the first time this garbage broke. Lesson learned. Stick with 
the big names htc samsung lg apple moto/lenovo...260 dollars down the drain. smh ..don't how 
this company is still around.....
