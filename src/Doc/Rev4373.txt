I didn't want to spend alot on a larger screened smart phone so this is 
what I decided to go with. Issues with this phone I find irritating are: swiping 
the screen to unlock automatically opens the camera - no option to make it stop. 
The auto fill of words while texting is beyond irritating when it makes up words 
you had no intention to use - unable to turn it off. The phone vibrates 
when the person you call picks up and they can hear it - something else 
that has no option to turn off. Even with a very clean screen, sometimes it's 
unresponsive. The pros of the phone are: the screen size, the graphics are decent, battery 
life is adequate, ability to add storage (unlike the Nexus phone I previously had). sound 
is good (don't expect symphony hall out of any phone). I'll probably replace this phone 
sooner rather than later.
