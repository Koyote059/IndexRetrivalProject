I have finally moved into the 21st C and signed up for a data plan, 
the lowest, of course. Anyway, I have an iPad and iPod, so I know how 
an iPhone works, and I like it's "i" features, except the phone. I don't know 
how other smart phones work, but I don't like that it takes several steps to 
make a call. You have to type in your security code, get out of the 
app you have open, open the phone app, and then either find the number you 
want to call in your favorites, recent calls, or you dial the number. I miss 
my speed dial on my "dumb phone." I wish you could use the device as 
a phone without having to open an app first. I'm sure I'm supposed to be 
using Siri to make my dialing experience better, but I don't always have the Cellular 
turned on and many times I want to dial the phone silently without making a 
voice command. I like the iPhone enough overall, though, not to give it a 3 
star rating.
