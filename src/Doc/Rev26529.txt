This LG G3 is fast and the screen is beautiful!I will reconfirm that the 4G 
will not work in the US on cricket wireless (AT&T network). But the 3G connection 
is plenty fast enough for my needs and I wanted a 1440p screen for under 
$300 that was also unlocked.Having both a user replaceable battery and expandable storage is excellent 
for users who would like to keep there phone for longer than a year.Battery life 
is good easily lasting throughout the day with average use.Software updates could be more frequent, 
this phone is still on android 5.0. Rumor has it that 6.0 will be released 
to the G3 but we'll have to wait and see.The LG software overlay is very 
functional and doesn't detract from the experience whatsoever.The camera takes excellent photos and is extremely 
fast to focus. The camera is beyond what most will ever need in a smartphone,You 
can even use this phone as a remote control but this feature isn't the greatest 
due to the poor range.I think this is still the only phone available with a 
1440p screen in this price range and the extra GB of ram on the international 
version is appreciated. I recommend buying a glass screen cover to protect the beautiful screen.
