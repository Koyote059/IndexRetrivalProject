it has a weak point at the pivot point. there is no repair for it. 
it broke when i was getting into my car an the otter box snagged on 
the door frame of my car. outside of that i couldn't say, since i only 
had it for 4 days. the rest of the otter box case appeared as though 
it would be great in protecting my cell phone. if the otter box company could 
fix the pivot point so that it wouldn't break so easy , i might buy 
another one. please forward to otter box with my name attached if you like. thank 
you tom postlethwaite
