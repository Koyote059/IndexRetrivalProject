Ok at first this phone was amazing but just after a few weeks it started 
acting up phone would get very very hot while charging some times screen would quit 
registering things. And there is some glitch where the volume buttons will cancel out of 
apps . Battery life is iffy but not awful was a great phone when it 
worked I replaced mine after less than a month
