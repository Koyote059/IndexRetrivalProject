Before this g2x i had the lg mytouch its was just a newer phone but 
i cracked the screen then i was looking for a new phone but i ran 
in to this on youtube i seen the review its an older model then my 
mytouch but the g2x has a bigger screen in hd its super fast on wifi 
and 4g and the game play is incredible the camea is amazing even the flash 
is sweet i jus wish the speaker was a bit louder but i got a 
sound booster but its watever the phone is amazing
