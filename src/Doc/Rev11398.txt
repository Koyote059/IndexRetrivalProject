Blu is known for making budget devices so when I saw they made a real 
flagship I decided to buy and test it out. It's fast, well built and the 
screen is good( however it could have been better). Camera takes decent shots in the 
light but suffers in the dark. The phone also rebooted on me 3 times yesterday 
for no reason. The phone is fast but if you own a s6 or a 
6p like I do, you will notice the slower speeds. Compared to the one plus 
one and two, this device feels more annoying to use. The UI is just not 
as polished, but not as bad as other phones in this price range. Its UI 
is easily better than that of the asus zenphone 2 for those who were wondering. 
Hopefully marshmallow update fixes the annoying UI. Overall 3/5, not bad for a first try 
at a real flagship.*Update, After about 6 months of owning this phone it started to 
randomly reboot/overheat. Whenever I started it , the screen would display "android is optimizing apps." 
and then reboot. Apparently it's a common problem from what I've read online. I plan 
to contact BLU support for a warranty replacement as this is clearly a manufacturer issue. 
I will later update my review to include their customer service.*Update I've been on hold 
for 3 hours and still 15 people ahead of me. It's like they have 1 
person dealing with all phone calls. Terribly long wait times. My review has dropped from 
4 to 1 star now.Update *After being put on hold for 6 hours and finally 
being next in line the company hung up on me. Disgusting customer service really. Would 
give it 0/5 if I could.
