I would have to honestly say the life xl lte is a whole lot of 
phone for the price. Great display, 4g lte working flawless on Tmobile network. Super fast 
without any lag or buffering so far. The quality of this phone compared to other 
well known brands "in the same price range" is far more superior. Great feel in 
the hands and very light. I've had quite a few friends "that have other well 
known brand phones" take a look and try it out and now wish they bought 
this instead of the more expencive brands they have. Another plus is the dual sim 
feature. I do travel abroad and cant wait to use this feature. The only issue 
I have at this time is the lack of phone case and screen protector options, 
but this phone was just released so i would imagine there will be some on 
the market soon. All i can say is i'm so satisfied with this phone and 
will not hestate on purchasing Blu cell phones in the future.
