So far this is the nicest phone I've owned. My second Huawei phone and the 
quality of their products has only gotten better imo. The design and build quality of 
this phone makes the jet black iphone look ordinary and the battery life makes the 
iphone look pathetic. I don't mind the EMUI that much, but am a real fan 
of Google Now, so went straight to that launcher. The settup was pretty easy, though 
it did not simply mirror my apps and settings from my other phone, so I 
had to download and install my favorite apps one at a time. Since the phone 
is so fast, that did not take much time and it gave me the chance 
to explore settings and features while I was doing the tasks. Camera results are superb 
though I have much more to learn about the options and features provided. Signal strength 
for both wifi and network are the best I've had in my rural local. So 
far I'm totally pleased with this item and found a case I really like, though 
I'd much rather use the phone without a case. That is not, however, a practical 
every day option. Drops could be fatal with so much glass exposed. I'll update more 
here if I change my point of view, but for now this is a winning 
choice for my needs and taste.
