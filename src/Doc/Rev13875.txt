size and performing phones is now at an end. A new era is dawning before 
us, and we are now greeted with a device that is affordable, practical, and beautiful. 
BLUâs latest product is both useful and a beauty to behold. While reviewing this product, 
note that the price ($128.99) is always a big factor for saying why such is 
Plus or Minus.FULL DISCLOSURE: I BOUGHT THREE OF THESE FOR MY CHILDREN WITH MY OWN 
MONEY, BEFORE ANY OF THE REVIEWS ARE POSTED.Specs:= 1.3GHz MediaTek MT8382 Quad-Core CPU= MALI 400

Buttons- No accessories *yet*- No camera flash- SIM Card Slot / SD Card Slot Cover 
is cumbersomeImprovement Required:* Better display, with only 600x1024 (169 ppi), BLU has better resolution on 
their other lineup within similar price range* More RAM (at least 2GB)* Support for LTE* 
Better resolution cameras* 5Ghz WiFi Band* Protective CaseVerdict:The Phone is nicely done, and works as 
expected. It has strong signal (AT&T Prepaid), and it performed well on WiFi and Mobile 
Speedtest. I like how the phone feels, and it doesnât look cheap. I really like 
the idea of the phone coming with screen protector, but an included protective case would 
be awesome. It would have not been a problem if there are available cases in 
the market. I finally found a case that fits though, but I found one that 
works and I just made a few modifications.My biggest gripe for this would be the 
resolution and PPI. BLU could have easily add more resolution or increase PPI. Next will 
be an additional 1GB of RAM (even 0.5GB) to make sure everything runs better and 
smoothly, even if it means BLU need to bump to the price.As for game performance, 
I found out some game stutter a bit, but not to the point of being 
a deal breaker. At this price point, it is a great Media Consumption device (tablet) 
while being a full blown phone.Overall, this is a great device as a main phone 
with huge screen. I wanted to give it four stars due to the two big 
gripes I have, but considering the price, this phone does not disappoint.
