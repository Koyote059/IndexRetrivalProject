It's not great, but definitely neat. I have an iPhone so Apple isn't exactly cooperative 
as they have their own products they have spent millions developing. The speaker isn't loud, 
and the corded headset is awkward and earbuds are hard to use. Phone calls work, 
but I did have to put the watch up to my ear to hear clearly 
at one point. The Bluetooth range is short approximately 10 feet. It works great through 
my phone via Bluetooth for music and talk through other Bluetooth speakers that are also 
sync to my phone. I got a micro sd card and put music on it, 
it only plays in file manager. Hooked up to a Bluetooth speaker on its own, 
it skips and sound quality is poor. It's so bad, I now want to return 
it. This makes it the worst MP3 player I've ever had, considering the wired headphones 
are very uncomfortable. I haven't tried to pair it with my newer Toyota yet. I 
bought this just to see if a smart watch is something I would like. $50 
is cheap enough considering what I'm going to be spending on a nice watch. It's 
helping me figure out what I want. I've already seen a lot better watches on 
Amazon, w cameras. I paid $38 for this watch, it was too much, and the 
price went up since I bought it. If it paired up and played music better 
on it's own I would be happier.
