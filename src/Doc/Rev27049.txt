The best android phone I've owned, hands down. When price to performance comes into play, 
nothing else can beat it. The battery life, the performance, professional camera mode (the camera 
is great and lag free when you understand how to use it), customization and tap-wake 
gestures make this phone have everything I've loved about from all the flagships I've personally 
owned in one neat package with a beautiful, not-to saturated, display. Included accessories to boot 
make this even a better buy - don't wait, this is a repackaged phone from 
Gionee (with a much more superior kernel at the cost of 1gb ram) so when 
its sold out, it probably will stay sold out.Seriously, wow, great job Blu. Hate that 
your code isn't open source but the promised upgrade to 6.0 isn't that bad. Shame, 
but its what you get for the price, still, kudos to turning in Gionee's pile 
of crap into this![Geekbench 3: Single @600, Multi @ 2600] Dont plan to play World 
of Tanks Blitz, but it blows through anything else popular and somewhat intensive~
