First off the seller does not make it clear that you can't just put in 
any Sim card and expect it to work on your carrier. If you're getting this 
phone for metro pcs then you have to call in and have the phone activated 
through them. Have your EMI number at hand which can be found by dialing *#06# 
after you give them the EMI number they will have your phone working within a 
few mins. It's such a great phone it really is. Absolutely beautiful. No regrets
