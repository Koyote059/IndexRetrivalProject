This is a GREAT phone for the many, many of us that want a PHONE, 
not an overpriced piece of techno glitter with a bazillion features we neither want nor 
use. Why U.S. cellular providers do not offer this or similar phones is a mystery 
to me.It's classic Nokia - solid build, clear and logical user interface, real keyboard, good 
size clear display, camera that's fine for the occasional quick photo and it's affordable. As 
to the power consumption issue that has appeared in some European reviews, I just don't 
see it - I fully charged the phone over 2 days ago, have left it 
on - with Bluetooth enabled - and made several calls and the battery shows 75% 
full. Works for me !
