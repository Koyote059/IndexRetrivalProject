These phones are certainly not factory unlocked. The phone is tied explicitly to t-mobile which 
wreaks of false advertisement. Furthermore, part of factory unlocked indicates the phone is rooted. You 
must root it if you intended to purchase a factory unlocked phone. Don't even try 
to use it on the data network for ATT - it won't work. All it 
is good for on ATT is to place phone calls - and not even internationally.
