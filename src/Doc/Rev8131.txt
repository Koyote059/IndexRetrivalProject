I WAS SO MAD when I opened the shipping box! The listing for the phone 
CLEARLY states the phone advertised for sale is an AT&T model N910A. But I received 
an N910T! I immediately went to the Return section and got ready to ship the 
smartphone back to wherever it came from! BUT WAIT! I did a little more research 
into the 910T model and found that the Seller had actually done me a ***HUGE 
FAVOR***! Not only is the N910T a slightly more robust phone (with just a little 
more radio power output than the AT&T model), it could be rooted, which you CANNOT 
do (afaik) with the AT&T model Note 4. So, long story short, I endured the 
annoying T-Mobile boot jingle just long enough to download a custom ROM and now I'm 
enjoying slightly increased battery life (many Note 4's are battery hogs, IMO) and almost all 
the snazzy features of a Galaxy S7 Edge, ported onto my phone by the custom 
ROM. This is still an excellent phone for anyone not interested in rooting and modifying 
your phone's features but it is an even better platform for those who do things 
like that. Bottom line: YES, I would buy another one of these phones from this 
Seller. I've had the phone for enough time to give it a solid thrashing to 
determine its usability - and it will do! It will do just fine! :)
