Not sure is this apply just to Puerto Rico, be a phone's issue or just 
my particular situation but I'll write about it as it might be helpful to someone 
else. Purchased it for its many advertised functions and price to replace an Iphone 4 
using NET10 prepaid services for which every service was working fine except not able to 
update IOS. Almost always had a 4G next to the antenna symbol on phone's display. 
Inserted the Iphone 4 sim card into my Blu Studio, program APN, able to call, 
connect to the Internet, send and receive mms messages, receive text messages from anyone but 
able to SEND text messages to about 4 people out of my 200+ contacts. Tried 
about 30 different APN's combinations looking to solve the problem, visited twice a cell phone 
store for help even purchased a new sim card just in case but nothing worked. 
NET10 tech support super text message diagnosis test was to send a text message to 
myself and because I was able to received, for them their system "was not the 
problem". Used without sending text messages for quite a while. Switched to Claro Puerto Rico 
prepaid mobile service by also purchasing ANOTHER new sim card. Now I'm able to call, 
use 3G Internet, (4G symbol never shows) send and receive text messages from and to 
anyone BUT now cannot send nor receive mms messages. Call Claro's tech support (excellent service) 
we went thru APN settings and according to them my phone IS NOT 4G (Why 
then a 4G indication with NET10 plan?) and was recommended to purchase a 3G sim 
card and prepaid plan. I started searching on Internet on how to find out if 
my phone is or isn't 4G capable and found this webpage http://www.willmyphonework.net/ with a web 
application which after entering my phone specs the results were as follows:Blu Studio C Super

to enjoy using my new phone "capabilities" and still in need to purchase another sim 
card for 3G + a 3G prepaid plan. Product purchased on October 15, 2015 reviewed 
in January 20, 2016My experience does not necessarily has to be your experience but I 
hope might somehow help someone else.A happy customer, always very satisfied with Amazon's services and 
prices. Thank you for your continuous efforts in costumer's satisfaction.Hope BLU could improve such a 
pretty product IF this might be related to design functioning. Would like to go back 
to Iphone but not affordable at this time. Not really a fan of android for 
its privacy concerns.Thanks for your time to read such a long review.Rafael
