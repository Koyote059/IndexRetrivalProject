It seemed good at first....until I went to activate it. I'm not sure if the 
problem was on the part of the phone or the carrier. I couldn't send or 
receive picture messages, and after contacting customer service for both I still couldn't come to 
a solution. I thought, okay, I can live without MMS. After a month the phone 
just DIED. Wouldn't charge. Wouldn't turn on. DEAD. Contacted BLU customer service, and they replied 
once every week or two weeks. There was no consistency, and they wanted me to 
pay to return the phone to be worked on. I had another BLU phone for 
years, and it was amazing. I'm surprised at the poor quality of this phone. It 
makes me not want to try again with BLU.
