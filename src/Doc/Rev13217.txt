I have had this phone before and loved it . It has features I hadn't 
even learned how to use yet but just when I wanted to add the web 
to it, the hinge cracked. I'd had the phone for years and really liked it 
so when it cracked, I was on the hunt for a new one only to 
find out that I couldn't replace it through any Verizon stores any more. They told 
me to try third party vendors but to be wary of those with bad reviews 
and mindful that some phones are stolen. So, Amazon was my next search and with 
its A-Z guarantee, I took a chance with this vendor with whom I am extremely 
satisfied and would definitely recommend! I got my phone much sooner than the estimated delivery 
date, the condition was new, as promised, and it works great! I love it and 
have added the web; it's a great phone and am very happy to have found 
this vendor who helped me replace my original. Thank you!
