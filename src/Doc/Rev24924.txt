I've had the Cookie for about a month now and I am so happy with 
my purchase!It was fully charged when I received it and all the mentioned items were 
in the box, including the charger with adaptor. I slipped my SIM card in (I 
have T-Mobile Even More service) and it immediately recognized T-Mobile as the carrier; even shows 
it onscreen!Spent approximately 20 minutes playing around with the settings as they are organized a 
bit differently from U.S. phones...for instance, the settings for ring tones are under the "Settings-Profile-Normal" 
names, not the usual ones we see here. However, it's pretty easy and the touchpad 
appears to become more responsive with time as you get used to it.The QWERTY keyboard 
is great and the accelerometer function works quite well for typing with either [small] fingers 
or the stylus. People have received my texts promptly, as I have theirs. Anyone considering 
this phone would do well to check the services their provider offers - if you 
don't have an Internet plan, well, the phone won't surf the 'Net - I say 
this because I've seen a couple of complaints about that issue. I don't use my 
phone for that purpose, just calls and texting, and it's perfectly suited for such. Also, 
this is NOT a wi-fi or 3G equipped phone, which again suits my needs but 
perhaps not others...they'll have to spend a bit more for that and sacrifice battery life. 
Speaking of battery life, I am a fairly heavy talker and only charge my phone 
every 3-4 days - and it charges in less than a couple hours.All in all, 
if you're patient and like to fiddle with new gadgets as I do, you will 
LOVE this phone. The wallpapers, ringtones and games are really great and again, I'm extremely 
happy with my little Christmas present to myself!
