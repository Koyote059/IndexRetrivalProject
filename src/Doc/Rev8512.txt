I purchased this phone after I dropped and cracked the screen of my Samsung3 (still 
had 6 months remaining until I could upgrade). This phone was a huge disappointment. It 
was very slow, dropped calls often, and did not hold a charge very well. I 
ended up going back to my broken phone until my upgrade became available. The only 
good thing about it was its compact size.
