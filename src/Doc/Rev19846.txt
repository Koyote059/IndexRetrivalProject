I bought this cellphone March of 2016 and was shipped from HongKong fast. Today, after 
6.5 months, my phone's charging capability is acting weird. My phone just warms up then 
drains the battery completely. I have to charge it every now and then. Sometimes it 
would show me a higher charge than a few minutes ago. To start with, I 
think the seller gave me a generic charging cable (not the socket adaptor) because it 
had been giving me a message like charging is slow, use an HTC charger/cable (not 
the exact words but something like this, I since then replaced the cable with what 
I have so I cannot remember the message verbatim) Also, this was advertised as NEW. 
Maybe refurbished? Sellers should be honest in promoting the true value of their wares. I 
bought this cellphone for $242.00 so this better still work for me although the charging 
and the heating issues are increasingly frustrating. All my previous cellphones lasted me years with 
no issues at all. No money saved here and no good deal struck but a 
lesson well learnt.The 1 star is not for HTC, it's for the business owner who 
sold the generic and/or defective parts (battery, cable) to me. I would still buy HTC 
but from now on I would only buy from reliable vendors here in the States.
