This was a store demo phone, you CANNOT remove the demo software that takes over 
the phone shortly after turning it on. Verizon store actually tried for me but were 
unsuccesfful and said these phones are not supposed to ever get out to the public. 
Makes me wonder how the company got a hold of them.
