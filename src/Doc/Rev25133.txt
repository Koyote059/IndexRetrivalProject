Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910C Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, 32GB, Blackarrived on time and works 
ok,but other than that :1. The power and the volume buttons are "loosened" ,not tightly 
in place... its like the phone had been opened (refurbished? broken and fixed ?) before 
I am really upset because of that. I have another note 4 - I know 
how the buttons supposed to be and feel in a new phone.2. BUYER BEWARE: like 
other reviewers said before, the box had been OPENED.its not hard tell - there is 
a special Samsung seal (blue sticker) on original unopened box. mine had just a simple 
white sticker to keep the box closed.3. the phone (note 4 model N910C Unlocked) is 
form United Arab Emirates.
