Where to start...Well this was a very frustrating experience to say the very least! The 
phone I revived was neither Sprint, or refurbished. Do not buy from this seller unless 
you throughly enjoy being dicked around and having your time wasted.From the start I was 
upset a faster shipping method was not available. After waiting a week for the phone 
I revived a phone just about as broken as the one I was replacing. There 
were huge starches all over the screen... Deep ones I am not sure how the 
screen was still intact! There was actual gouges missing out of the plastic sides. It 
heated up while attempting to charge, the 3 hours it was on the charger before 
it would turn on! Then I finally got the hunk of 185$ crap on.. I 
re program it 3x and keep getting a message about the SIM card do I 
look up how to switch that out as it didn't come with a sprint or 
any other SIM card... Then I get a message that the phone is locked. So 
I spend an hour on the phone with sprint.. turns out this ugly paper weight 
is not even a sprint phone. So 2 more weeks I get a refund.. So 
glad I missed all those calls, not like I was trying to find a job 
or anything! Seriously one of the worst experiences I have had on Amazon. Avoid wasting 
your time and money.
