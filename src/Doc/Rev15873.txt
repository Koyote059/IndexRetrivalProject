I REALLY liked this phone. The size/shape/feel to me were exactly what I wanted. It 
felt substantial and solid. The layout and buttons were exactly where I intuitively wanted them. 
When I found this phone, I was happy to finally find a smart phone I 
felt was set up the way I wanted a phone to be. I even liked 
the look and feel of the Windows phone OS on this device. The holster for 
it was also perfect for me.Unfortunately, the Windows phone OS had too many issues. It 
would reboot w/out warning. Settings would be lost. I don't know if it was the 
OS, or the OS working in tandem with this hardware, or something else entirely, but 
I just had too many problems with this one.After about 14 days I sent it 
back to the vendor for a refund. The vendor was great about refunding for the 
phone.T-Mobile (my carrier) no longer stocks/sells this phone. I was told they had too many 
problems with it.The newer Nokia's that T-Mobile carries running Windows phone OS are OK, but 
I think this model was better to what they stock now (except for the obvious 
fact that the phone/OS combo had issues). Maybe someone will take on the challenge of 
porting Android over to this phone. Nokia created what I think is a fantastic piece 
of hardware.
