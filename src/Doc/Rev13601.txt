This is indeed a nice phone but it isn't entirely unlocked. I bought this phone 
to use with Straight Talk and while it will make calls with my Straight Talk 
Sim card in the phone it will not access data without having a WiFi source. 
The software in this particular phone will not allow you to change the APN settings 
in the phone. I'm sure there is some way around this but I couldn't find 
any instructions on how to do it without rooting the phone which is said to 
void the warranty and I didn't feel that I should have to go through all 
of that anyway so the phone is being returned for a refund.Bottom line, if you 
are an AT&T customer this is a great phone and a good deal. If you 
are a Straight Talk customer save yourself some time and look for something else.-I would 
also like to note that i contacted the seller and they were nothing but helpful, 
I give their customer support an A+
