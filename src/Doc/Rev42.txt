I had this phone for nearly 2 month and I say super big and smooth 
and bright and way better than that blu 7 inch .1 connect to metro pcs 
and text with no problem picture messenger work flawless yes it comes with the Chinese 
app but that no problem just disabled then you good no bother to me everything 
on this works great it awesome phone camera super great front and the back take 
great selfie too battery is great too last a great deal of even on heavy 
uses and this phone never shuts off it is a great investment of my money 
oh I drop this phone 6 times already and in great condition no chips or 
blemishes still in pristine condition and the screen has noooo scratches high highly recommend this
