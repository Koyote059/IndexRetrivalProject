I was impressed by the reviewer who said that this phone is all he needs 
("plus a bag of chips"). His review "spoke to me", because I really don't care 
about cell phones. I am always leaving my cell phone in my briefcase turned off. 
I feel no need to play with cell phones, probably since I deal with technology 
all day long in my work.I ordered this phone, but unfortunately learned that the phone 
does not work with my phone service. Another major disappointment: This "watch" phone does not 
have a watch feature.
