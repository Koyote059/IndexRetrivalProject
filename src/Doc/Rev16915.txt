I had the i9205 model previously and loved it, though since you cannot use the 
LTE antenna in the USA anyways, grab this i9200 and enjoy longer battery life!Every little 
hiccup/short coming with the i9205 is simply not present on the i9200, the i9200 is 
PERFECT. I thought I was compromising and taking a slight downgrade but the i9200 turned 
out to be better, period. So if like me you're hesitating to get the i9200 
because you think the i9205 is superior, you're mistaken like I was, so long as 
you're in the USA, the i9200 reigns supreme!SOLID AMAZING PHONE!
