Not unlocked, took it to AT&T today to switch my sim card from my 5s 
to the new 6s Plus....no go! Super bummed out! So now I've gotta take it 
to the Apple Store, which is in the mall...I hate going to the mall...and hope 
that they can unlock the phone. I pray that they don't tell me it's a 
fake, like some of the other reviews I've read. This is a pain in the 
butt, will probably just end up returning the phone, thats how much I hate going 
to the mall. Boo to false advertising!
