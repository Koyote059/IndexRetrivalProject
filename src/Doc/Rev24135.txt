Very good! The only thing is that the only case you can get is the 
clear gel case. They don't make any other cases! But it has very good pictures, 
only that the camera is a bit laggy, but very minimally. The headphones have an 
incredible sound quality, too! I like the fact that it has internal flash, too. The 
only thing is that the screen protector makes the colors a TINY bit more matte, 
but who cares? The battery lasts very long, and I did not expect it to 
come with a plug adapter for Europe, but it did! This phone is a very 
good choice! It costs about $80 less on Amazon, as it costs $200 on http://www.poshmobile.com/Buy 
this phone!
