Ok so i had this phone for about 3 months and its not bad. The 
size is good. The main camera isn't all that bad but isn't really that good 
either. The front camera on the other hand is just bad it's a VGA so 
it has no flash, and you need really good lighting to get a decent picture 
in th dark it's useless. It actually comes pre-installed with the ICS 4.1 not the 
4.0 as advertised. When you download the apps you have the option to store on 
phone or on the sd card. if you save the apps to the phone itreally 
starts to lag. when you have the apps on the sd card it runs smoother 
but any time that any of the apps need tobe updated the phone will start 
lagging again so keep checking for updates. the shipping was great i can never coplain 
when using the prime shipping. over all a good phone for the money
