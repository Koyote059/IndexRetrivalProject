Really love the high resolution screen of this phone. All the pictures and videos look 
better on this phone. Camera is great. I especially love the slow motion video function, 
I took lots of videos during my son's baseball game. Then we could replay at 
home and my son gets to know how he swings the bat. Also, this Sunday, 
when we took a few pictures with the sun on back of kids, the pictures 
from my husband's Galaxy S6 are way worse than my Axon. The pictures from Axon 
have enough light on kids faces, not like the dark faces from Galaxy S6. Also 
the color of pictures looks much more real than the Samsung ones.It comes with RockMyRun, 
which I use a lot during my workout with the inbox JBL earbuds. Those beats 
can really stimulate my movements. Sound quality is amazing! It's even better with the Bose 
noise cancellation headphones.Metal body is cool, a little bit heavy, but I guess that's inevitable 
with a 5.5 inch big screen and all those metal.Overall, I enjoy using this phone.
