Have been using the phone for a week. My observations; I'm using the phone with 
Metropcs, purchased a SIM card at Walmart for 10 dollars. To avoid paying the $15 
charge at a Metro store, installed the card and got it connected over the phone. 
Text and voice were working but could not get data to work. Called Metro twice 
and still not working. Came across a google search that had the APN settings. (but 
not for this phone ) I think what made it work was turning on IPV6.The 
phone works and it's reasonably fast, but the battery life sucks. Last only a few 
hours with moderate use. Let's face it, a smart phones gets used a lot by 
most people. If you want a phone that the battery last, this phone is not 
for you.The camera is not that good, it takes high resolution pictures but they seems 
out of focus and colors are not life like.The display is good and video plays 
well on it, again can't see watching a 2 hour movie on it because of 
the battery life.Conclusion, if you can afford a bit more money then don't buy this 
phone. If you max is no more than $200 you can do worse.Update: Removed gmail 
app, bettery lasted the whole day. The GPS does not work. Installed GPS monitoring tool 
and can see that the signal is constantly being lost. Will call BLU tech support 
and see what they say. ( Other reviews claim the same GPS issue)
