This phone works, but it doesn't come with any product documentation and there isn't anything 
except a sales brochure on the website. I found out through trial and error that 
this phone has essentially no usable memory. The 32 MB / 24 MB RAM that 
BLU claims on their website is false, it's actually more like 34 KB. I discovered 
this when I couldn't import my contacts into the phone. Unless you have all of 
your numbers already stored on a SIM card, this phone is pretty much useless without 
adding a microSD card to it.UPDATE:I dropped the rating from 2 stars to 1. It 
turns out saying the phone works was an overstatement. It works sometimes. The reception of 
this phone is terrible, so often the network status just shows as "Emergency Call". If 
you're looking for an inexpensive phone that you can actually make/receive calls with, I'd buy 
something else.
