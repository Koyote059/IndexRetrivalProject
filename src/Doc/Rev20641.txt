i was a iphone user got tired of everytime I had a issues with my 
device I had to travel out of my way to get my phone service.i decided 
after the iphone 4s to leave contract behind me and go with another type of 
phone. I been having a blu phone for a few years ,and I most admit 
NO it's not one of the high dollar end phones ,but it does EVERYTHING I 
need it to do.i love my phone I started out with a blu studio 5.5, 
battery life wasn't all that, and I changed over to the blu dash 5.5, and 
I simply love it battery life last 24 hours camera takes beautiful pics it also 
is equip with auto focus different scenes to chose from .and the resolution for this 
particular phone to me is GREAT everyone compliments me on my phone wish I would 
have gotten that 6.0 ,but I cant sneak that in my pocket while I'm at 
work #giggling have a great day blu users I purchased the neon yellow with the 
gold trim around it.wish there was a blu phone community we could all chat in 
the phone is also upgraded to 44.4 kit kat and a better processor
