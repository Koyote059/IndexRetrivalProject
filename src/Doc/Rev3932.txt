My company standard for wireless communications is Blacberry, so, after I lost my old 8310, 
I decided to get the Gemini: good looking, newer OS, trackpad instead of the trackball.To 
this date, I'm very happy with the phone, I realize that there are very few 
functions this blackberry hasn't that are being offered on the most expensive and advanced models. 
Nevertheless, my use of the phone is very demanding (as well as our corporate standards) 
and it is usual to have to wait for the phone to stop showing th 
clock to start using it, which is the main reason to not rate it as 
a 5 star product.
