Everything about this phone is great, except the fact that it does an awful job 
picking up service. About every half hour it will stop picking up service. Even though 
I can visibly see the cell tower from my house my phone will say that 
I have no service for about 10 minutes. Then it will randomly change around from 
no service to four bars for a while. Then I'll have another half hour of 
proper functionality. I miss calls and get text messages 20 minutes late because of this. 
And after hard resting twice Blue tech support asked me to send it in the 
mail to them. I would need to pay for shipping and it would be gone 
for about 3 weeks, which is something I can't do.
