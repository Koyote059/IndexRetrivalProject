I really love it.!!! It's a very good phone. Maybe the camera and the battery 
are not the best but come on it's a young company and they going to 
improve a lot. But for the rest I love it, a very very good performance. 
I have the phone for 4 months until I was assaulted :'( but however... For 
the people take on mind that the color is like a black purple not a 
really purple one -_-. The phone runs faster I never noticed even a gag. I 
played games like FIFA 15, Need for Speed and others heavy games. For me the 
GPS works fine and it's good that the phone incorporates NFC and has slow motion... 
something that I really appreciate.
