Phone has potential but it needs some improvements. I honestly think its a steal for 
the price I paid. The camera is pretty nice. The quality is pretty good as 
well but I've had issues with the software and the keyboard is annoying. The accuration 
is off on the keyboard and the calibration is weak at times but other than 
that it's a pretty good phone.
