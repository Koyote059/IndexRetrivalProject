serves its function, terrible sound quality through speaker. i think mine blew out or something. 
everything else works great. other than the quality control issue with the speaker, i have 
yet to contact blue about.. i have been using this phone for about 3 months. 
its decently fast, apps work great. would get 5 stars if call speaker didn't blow 
out in the first week. question is would i buy it again? probably not. currently 
shopping for an lg or htc...Update- Contacted Blu via email. waiting for reply 5/17. Customer 
service so far is very impersonal.
