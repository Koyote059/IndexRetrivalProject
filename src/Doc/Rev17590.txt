My phone froze thin the first couple of days, it's also very inconvenient the way 
it's set up. The camera is really tricky and inconvenient. The whole camera process takes 
a lot of time to flip through your reel and get back to taking pictures. 
It's super frustrating because I want to see a picture and at the touch of 
a button quickly go back to my camera. This phone takes a long time to 
load anything. The camera quality is nice but not worth it. Might as well buy 
a cannon camera.
