Be very careful with these "refurbished" phones. The one I received had camera issues and 
an occasional unresponsive screen. I got lucky because the phone had 2 weeks left on 
the Apple warranty so Apple replaced it for free otherwise this definitely would have been 
sent back. If you have the time to mess with warranties and returns then go 
for it.
