I recently bought this device to upgrade from the Nokia N81 8gb, and so far 
I don't regret my decision.What I like about this 5800 Xpressmusic:1.- It has great reception2.- 
It is light (lighter than N81)3.- The big screen is nice, sensitive and requires zero 
calibration (not like the Palm TX I used to have some years ago)4.- The sound 
is even better than the one in the N815.- The Internet experience flows very well, 
you can even watch videos from youtube right from their website6.- GPS... mixed feelings tough, 
nice to have one, hard to master it, weak reception7.- The menus are very easy 
to get used to, very well organized, and you can still change their order or 
create folders to your own preference.8.- You have 4 different options for writing, from handwriting, 
to large full qwerty keyboard in the touch screen9.-The accelerometer works very well on directing 
the screen for vertical or horizontal display.10.- It comes with a micro SD 8gb (reads 
up to 16gb cards)11.- The PC Suite works great for sync with PC12.- Good to 
have a 3.2 megapixel camera (although I would only use it for emergencies, since the 
quality of small sensors is on the very low side)13.- Nice calendar, helps keep up 
with duties (although I would like some color code for different activities or meetings, something 
I liked from the Palm TX -although this is not the strength of this device, 
it is music, so well forget what I just said...)On the weaker side,1.- You cannot 
see the phone number of any of your contacts when you have dialed it. You 
have to enter in the full contact menu to see the phone number.(Still a defect 
also found in N81, you have to enter in the contacts to do that)2.- GPS 
has very low reception, so even a tinted window of the car can block the 
signal3.- Battery life does not seem to last as much as Nokia claims.4.- I miss 
the 4 way button from N81 (HTC has one for their touch screen models too) 
This is especially useful to scroll over long pages such as contact lists, moving among 
missing calls, or just navigating the internet, where if you touch the screen you can 
easily activate a link.5.- Plastic feels like the shell of an egg (but I guess 
that's the only way to get small but technologically complex devices)6.- Does not come with 
protective plastic for the screen (the N81 came with an excellent one from factory)7.- Terrible 
image organizer and editing. In N81, you could make albums, navigate over the photos and 
edit them in few steps, but now, the 5800 does not offer you the album 
option, you can make a folder and put the photos in, but if you want 
to rotate them you can quickly do it but won't save the image like that, 
you need to go the edit to change it, which involves 4 or 5 steps, 
and once you save it, it takes the image out of the folder you put 
it in!!8.- I am not into gaming, but the touchscreen games are like for kinder 
kids, forget about the great engage!So then, why is that I am giving this hot 
toy 3 1/2 stars?Because it is still dragging some few defects coming from the N81, 
and considering that I am reviewing a cell phone, beyond the nice extras, after all...The 
calling experience might not be so fluent...When you call someone, you cannot see their phone 
number if you need it quickly. I have to go back over the more than 
600 contacts to find the phone number I just called... those of you who have 
a Nokia know how this can bother big time... (based on the same Symbian platform 
as N81)You can press the green call for starting a conversation or you can touch 
a button in the screen to do the same, so why to duplicate? Same for 
ending a phone call.The missing 4 way button (from N81) would have been great to 
navigate the nice extras of the phone without "aiming" well with the tip of your 
finger. But hey, N97 is coming, for a difference of price too.Overall, I recommend (barely) 
this cell phone, great reception (although this might depend on your service provider), fantastic sound, 
fluent Internet experience, excellent extras, outstanding screen and resolution, perfectly calibrated!UPDATE June 17, 2009.Cons... Regarding 
webmail....1.- If you are answering a message on the webmail (Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, etc) say 
you wrote a paragraph of 10 lines and you need to add something to the 
4th line of the paragraph, you CANNOT place the cursor in between, you have to 
delete all previous 6 lines to get to the position where you can edit your 
response. Now, if you don't mind that it is fine, I tend to review what 
I write and often add or rewrite an idea.2.- Since you cannot place the cursor 
wherever you want to to write webmail, if you are answering an email and you 
want to include the original senders message (what is normal) your message will start at 
the end and not the beginning (as normal) In order to start at the beginning 
you would have to delete the sender's original message!Regarding crashing...3.- In several occasions it has 
crashed, meaning that you hung-up a call and freezes, the solution is take the battery 
off and put it back.4.- In several occasions when you are browsing the web and 
touch the middle of the screen it closes the browser and disconnects... anyone with that 
problem? I has happened to me 1 in every 10 times or so.I am starting 
to think that Nokia could read my review to consider these annoying issues on future 
updates! :))
