This is a great little phone, updates to Windows 8.1 Update 1 "Denim" upgrade with 
Glance support. If you can get used to the UI the Windows Phone "Metro" interface 
really grows on you. The Windows Store is missing some first party apps but 3rd 
parties do have some nice alternatives, sometimes even better than their official Android equivalents.That being 
said beware shady sellers in the "New" item listings. I had to re-order this phone 
3 times, each time buying from the a "new" listing before I got one in 
an acceptable condition. Make sure your batteries are OEM and have "Nokia" branded on them 
because I found the generic one that shipped with my first handset to have inferior 
battery life.Likewise make sure the charger and cable each are properly branded "Nokia", the 2nd 
one I ordered was a generic unbranded charger that charged much slower than an official 
one did.
