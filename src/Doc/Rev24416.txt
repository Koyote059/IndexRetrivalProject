I had two Nokia smart phones before, the latest being the model E72. It is 
impressive how Nokia made a the phone operation even easier than before, the menus are 
very intuitive and when in doubt, just click the help option for instant access to 
the user manual.I was familiar with the PC Suite software but the new Ovi software 
is a step ahead for seamless integration with MS Outlook and PC communication. It is 
also worth to mention that the Nokia C6 can be used as a modem, connecting 
your notebook PC to the internet enywhere there is a GSM or 3G network available.The 
battery life is much better than other touch screen phones out in the market, such 
as iPhone. My wife has a Motorola Dext Blur and the battery life gets nowhere 
near the C6!This model is highly reccommended for people over 45 like me that is 
having trouble reading texts in small screens, that was one of the reasons for replacing 
my E72 for the C6.A warning for Nokia users of E-Series phones: don't expect the 
battery of touch screen phones to last as much as that of your phones, this 
is a price to pay to have a bigger screen.I bought this smart phone for 
professional use so it was good to see that configuring the e-mail accounts were fast 
and easy.For those who like to listen music on the cell phone a piece of 
advice: use a good quality ear buds instead of the of the headset that comes 
with the phone. You will be surprised with the high quality of the sound of 
the Nokia C6.The 5MP camera takes great pictures and there is even a built in 
LED flash that does a good job when the ambient light is weak.Possibly the only 
downside that I have experienced so far is that the screen is easy to scratch, 
apparently Nokia saved money using a low quality material there. I advise the purchase of 
plastic skins along with this phone, this will provide protection aginst scratching. On the other 
hand the touch screen works well, no worries there, though I prefer to use the 
keyboard which has a scroll for up/down/left/right control of the screen and menus.
