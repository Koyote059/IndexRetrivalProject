This was a birthday gift for my girlfriend to replace her Nokia Lumia 600 series 
phone. This 925 Nokia looked nearly unused. The seller even put a screen protector on 
it, and it didn't have any air bubbles showing which is a major pet peeve 
of mine. I put in my Girlfriends T-Mobile SIM card in there and voila!! It 
connected to the network (4G, and LTE) and she was happy to have a phone 
with better cameras and all the other advantages of the 925 over the older 500 
and 600 series phone.My girlfriend was extremely gracious and appreciative for the gift and made 
sure to let me know in her own special ways.
