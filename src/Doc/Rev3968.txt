I have static on the line, no matter where I am making the phone call 
from. The BlackBerry Facebook app us horrible.The phone back isn't removable so when I get 
to the point of battery replacement, I'd if I will just be out a phone 
or have to send it in for repairs. The battery life is ok, the camera 
works pretty well, and some of the other auto apps are nice, like the weather 
and compass ones. BlackBerry hub app is just annoying- I don't need yet another place 
to see that I have a fb notification, only to go into my fb app 
and not be able to view it. Also, I dont get the internet reception that 
I did with my Samsung.
