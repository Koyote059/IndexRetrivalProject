I'm very pleased with my choice,Android as OS has all that I need and is 
easy to use. This phone arrived in german but was easy to change the language 
comparing both manuals (english page 84 and german page 83)so was not a big deal.The 
touch screen is very sensitive and i've big fingers, so i've to write carefully to 
not make mistakes, well, i bet its all about practice. I downloaded many useful apps 
and there are so many to download yet.i love both: Samsung GT i5500 Galaxy 5 
and Android OS!better together!
