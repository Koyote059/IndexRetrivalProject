I have a Galaxy tablet. It works well with this mobile phone. The phone is 
not too large or too small. Perfect fit. It IS unlocked, as advertised. Had absolutely 
no problem at AT&T switching from my old phone to the new one. Easy to 
use, The only glitch...still can't get it to "read" my fingerprint. But will work on 
researching the troubleshooter when I have more time.
