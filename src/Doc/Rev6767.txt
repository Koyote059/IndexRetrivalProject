Overall good phone. Even though it's an off brand all the controls are familiar and 
easy to use. No surprises. Love the battery life. I can go 2 days without 
charging it with my level of use. (Facebook, YouTube, and texting all day). The only 
problem I have is trying to connect to internet, whether it be 4g from my 
carrier (att) or wifi. Still trying to figure that out. But overall an AMAZING phone 
for the money.
