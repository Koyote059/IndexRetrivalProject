I bought this phone shortly after seeing it, having gotten a good recommendation from a 
friend. The phone feels nice and has a very good layout. It seems to have 
enough power to get me through the day. However the battery is just okay. With 
only one background app running this phone lasted about 5 hours. It also required the 
fast charging cube in order to charge at a reasonable rate. If plugged into any 
other USB port it will only prolong the battery however it will still die. My 
only real problem though is that the company lists it as being compatible with any 
cell service carrier whether in the US or overseas. However, when I went to activate 
it through Verizon, which is one of the largest providers in America, I figured out 
that the phone is not compatible with the 700 mhz bandwidth that Verizon uses. The 
fact that this company lied about their phones compatibilities causes me to question what else 
they might have lied about. Maybe the phone isn't all that the company says it 
is.Pros-Great design(Seemingly)Very PowerfulGood OSCons-DOES NOT SUPPORT VERIZON
