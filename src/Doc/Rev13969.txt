Nothing special, Filled with Pre-installed Apps/Bloatware - Like many Asus Products it works, but seems 
like Asus does not care what end users think and just plop out what they 
feel people want. Camera is ok, Not Great, Speed is good, I just think Pre-installed 
Apps/Bloatware and lack of control to delete them makes this phone something I wish I 
didn't buy.Picture is ok and again nothing special
