I'm not someone who finds himself phone shopping very often, and really liked my last 
Nokia... but it went thru the wash and wasn't salvageable. So I went shopping. I 
hate the phones the networks have at the stores, I wanted something different, something with 
pizazz!I really love this phone - smaller than anticipated, but very much the scale that 
I prefer. Key features that I find a 'must have' in any phone is multi 
number contacts and speakerphone. This does both and then some. I was debating between the 
blue and the silver - and went with the blue, and I'm glad I did. 
However, it is very very susceptible to fingerprints, so I highly recommend the BodyGlove Cellsuit 
to keep it nice and free of smears. This is an unlocked phone, so the 
keypad and some of the programming is not US only - the dictionary for example 
is in Chinese I believe. It comes with a wide array of ring tones and 
the sound quality exceeded expectations. The camera also exceeds expectations and has a picture editor 
on board - cheesey frames, b&w, brightness, sharpness and sepia - but these functions do 
eat up battery life quickly.I am very much a Nokia man, and have been hesitant 
to buy Motorola, but Nokia currently has nothing that interests me, style wise and the 
2 gig micro sd ability intrigued me... by the way, have I told you how 
much I love this phone? I have yet to find a flaw.
