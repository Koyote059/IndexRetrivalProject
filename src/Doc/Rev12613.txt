The camera stopped working after only 6 months. If you Google this problem, you will 
find that it is very common. The warranty requires you to send it back to 
LG for repairs, instead of just sending you a new one. So now I am 
without a phone for the next 10-12 days (the time it takes from when I 
drop it in the mail to when I will get it back). Since I have 
to have a phone for work, like everyone else, I will be forced to purchase 
something else to use in the meantime.
