I must say, this phone's camera is one of the best I have ever used. 
I am a professional photographer, and this 13mp camera can keep up with my DSLR 
all day long. The 32GB of memory is more than I ever will need with 
all the Google Drive space I have and all the cloud option out there. The 
4GB of ram powers all my apps and web surfing with out a hiccup. I 
love the bright display and when using the JBL head phone, which is include in 
the box, my movie and gaming experience is out of this world. Only at $450.00 
USD, hands down this is the device to buy! I would highly suggest this phone 
to anybody that asks!
