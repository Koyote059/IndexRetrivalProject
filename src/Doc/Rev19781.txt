I have always been a fan of physical keyboards and this one is awesome. I 
am also grandfathered into an unlimited data plan with verison, so the price for this 
technology cant be beat. I got exactly what I paid for. A new phone, at 
a good price. If you are looking for the cutting edge phone and cant live 
without your "top of the line" products, this phone is simply not for you. Its 
old. But if you are also grandfathered into a good plan and do not want 
to have to renew your contract, I would suggest this phone.
