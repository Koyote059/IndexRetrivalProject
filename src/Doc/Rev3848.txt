Bought to use internationally for a few months. It operates on all the bands necessary 
for the countries I was going to, and is unlocked and sim-compatible, so it worked 
well for me. The gps abilities were a plus, and it was a reasonable price. 
If you're looking for a good phone to use abroad, this is the one. Don't 
buy this for domestic use, though, since there are better phones that will work domestically, 
that are sim-compatible, that are unlocked, and that are cheaper (look at Moto first).
