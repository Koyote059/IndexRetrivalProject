The phone lasted a whopping 3 months. It wouldn't recognize a charger unless you literally 
held it jammed in there. Freezes, crashes, repeat. Downloading music onto this phone is miserable 
and it resets all your playlists every time you do. Lousy camera. All around terrible 
phone. I know its hard to part with a slide out keyboard and there isn't 
much on the market anymore with one, but I promise you will be happier with 
a touch screen keyboard than with this phone.
