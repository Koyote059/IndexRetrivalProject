I received the device on time that's the only positive. The phone was completely defective, 
the speaker was in horrible condition it sounded like I was talking under water, really 
muffled. And I'd place a call and the only way I can be heard is 
if I'm on speaker. The charger didn't work and the battery drained way to quick 
and believe me I adjusted all my settings. I have to charge it 3 times 
a day not kidding.
