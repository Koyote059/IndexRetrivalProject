Shipping was on time and when first opened the phone seemed fine. After I activated 
the phone I tryed to remove the plastic packing film that comes on the scfeens 
of all "new" phones, when I did that the hole front screen came off with 
it. Also the USB cable used for chraging was bent so I would have to 
bend it just to get a charge. It seemed to me that this phone was 
not NEW as advertised but REFURBISHED. Im very upset and stuck.
