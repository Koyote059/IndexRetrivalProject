I was a little nervous to purchase this unlocked cell phone due to some of 
the reviews I read, but all of my worries disappeared once it arrived to my 
home. It got here on time and in great condition. The phone it's self is 
a budget phone, but it works beautifully with my Net10Wireless plan and looks exactly as 
is shown in the photos. It's surprising fast and more up to date than I 
expected. I'm able to get certain apps on this phone that I wasn't able to 
get before with my Samsung Galaxy S3. Such as Pokemon Go, Vine, and I am 
now able to get and use all of the Snapchat filters available. Great fun!However, some 
things that did bother me: The front facing camera for selfies works great but the 
outward facing camera on the back of the cell phone is a bit lower quality 
and is noticeably so. The charger cord is too short for my liking, and the 
set of headphones it came with are completely useless.Otherwise, this phone works great and I 
have had no problems with it so far. I'm evening considering buying two more for 
family members this Christmas. I would highly recommend!
