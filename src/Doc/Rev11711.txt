I'm very, very happy with this purchase. Refurbished is a scary word. It's hard to 
believe this wasn't a brand new phone. I suspect it was overstock or something. It 
looks to me like no one's ever touched it. It came in an original box 
with sealed, unused accessories. Then I was worried that maybe the battery was crap. But, 
it holds a charge like it's new and recharges exactly as expected. I chose this 
seller because the description was the closest to new (like new in original box) and 
they had a 98% satisfaction rating. It's a 16 GB phone, but I added the 
SD card so, no memory problems. There was a lot of software updating when first 
connected to the internet, but once done, away I went to the Verizon store to 
get activated (I guess you can do that from home, but I had to modify 
my plan). It's worked great since I've had it. Would buy again in a heartbeat 
(if I needed another S5).
