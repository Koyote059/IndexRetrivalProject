this is the phone i wanted, and i would have gave this product 5 stars 
if it came like i wanted.the shipping was fast, within a week FedEx calls and 
tell me that a package will be at my house the next morning, and that 
i need to sign it.about the phone, its great, fast, cheap, and one of the 
first phones of this new generation phones, therefore it will last long before i will 
need to replace, perfect buy for someone like me that isnt intrested in a contract, 
still getting used to cause i used iphone for the past 4 years.the phone also 
came with 8 gb class 4 (kingston) memory card, which i did see in other 
sites but not on this page, so i bought 16 gb mc just in case, 
so its great.now if you are looking for an unlocked device, this is not.its T 
mobile's htc and it even comes in their box and has the logo under the 
glass,above the screen and ofcourse tmobiles rom.the phone isnt unlocked, works only for tmobile, when 
you insert another sim it asks you to enter a password which the seller did 
not provide, after a long frustrating week with many calls, i was lucky enough and 
got T mobile to unlock it for me, because my friend is on t mobile.if 
you buy this phone you probably need it unlocked cause otherwise you would have bought 
it with a cotract from a network, or even live in another country and bought 
it cause it is cheaper on amazon.the seller did not contact me back so far, 
all through i managed to get it unlocked, if he will answer back i might 
change the review, but just letting you know, this is not unlocked, and if you 
are not on t mobile or have a way to unlock it, its a brick, 
might as well use at as a door stop.
