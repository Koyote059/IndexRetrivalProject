This is not a Sprint phone. It is a Boost phone that operates on the 
CDMA network which Sprint has.It CAN be used with the Sprint prepaid system, or the 
Boost prepaid system. But it can only be used on these prepaid systems.Also, the phone 
did not come with a UICC card. It took some time and research, but I 
was able to find the right one on Ebay and buy it for 9.00.The item 
description was ...Sprint Boost Virgin Micro SIM Card for Galaxy Tab 3, S4 Mini HTC 
Desire 207R.The important part is "207R." This is not a SIM card as it is 
thought of for the GSM phones. It is only used to enable the phone on 
the LTE network somehow. It does not contain personal information or contacts.
