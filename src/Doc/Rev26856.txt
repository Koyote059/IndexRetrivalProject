I feel cheated, the first thing that happen is that my daughter could only use 
the phone on handsfree when we took it to a repair shop the guy replaced 
the part for $40 buck. He showed us the amount of rust in the phone 
and told us it was not new now the track pad is not working, we 
took it to another repair shop and they changed it, still not working, they told 
us it is a problem with the underlying board which might be faulty. Isn't there 
some law against false adversting. I would like a refund or something. Amazon I will 
be contacting you shortly
