A cheap but fantastic phone. You may want to purchase a SIM card punch and 
a 'MicroSIM Nano Card Holder' if your current phone has a full size SIM card. 
That way you won't waste hours standing in line at the AT&T store. You could 
just punch a MicroSIM from your full sized SIM, but on your next phone upgrade 
you may need to punch a nanoSIM so why not get it out of the 
way. In the end, I just installed my, punched, SIM card into my new phone 
which recognized my AT&T service and I was off an running. Don't think you can 
punch your own SIM card, then you've never used a paper punch, it's very similar. 
Best of all you can buy everything is one place.
