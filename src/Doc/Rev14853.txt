Well, the love affair is over. I did not require much in terms of a 
phone, beyond making and receiving calls and texts. It did that. The main outstanding feature 
of this phone is the constantly changing, beautiful and seasonally appropriate graphics. Now, all that 
is gone and I can not read the screen.Unfortunately, about two weeks ago, I noticed 
a little blemish on the screen (it looked like a scorch mark). This deepened into 
a dark patch, obscuring any display on the upper right hand corner of the screen. 
Then last night, the screen went almost completely dark and nothing I have tried restores 
it. There is a very faint glow (maybe 5 % visibility) so I can't read 
texts nor the numbers in my address book, or caller id.I am very disappointed. For 
the money, I expected these features to last.
