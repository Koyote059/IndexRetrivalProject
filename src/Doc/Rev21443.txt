I'm loving it! Fantastic phone! It wish it had NFC so I could do Google 
pay or set up a few commands. It doesn't bother me much although it is 
slightly counter intuitive that the fingerprint sensor doesn't double as a home button.The phone is 
fast. It is super responsive. It takes a 128GB SD card! I LOVE IT!
