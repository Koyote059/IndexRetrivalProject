This is a great phone, good size, and great camera and wonderful value for money, 
even for double the money. However, I have two and both have the same problem 
- every time it is booted up we get "launcher 3 has stopped working'. It 
must fix itself because after a moment all the apps work. The main problem is 
that the only cases (wallet style) for this phone are much bigger than the phone 
and the slide mechanism to enable use of the phone breaks easily. I wish Posh 
would come out with their own clamshell or other cases.
