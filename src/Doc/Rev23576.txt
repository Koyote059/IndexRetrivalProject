Very capable smartphone that can be used internationally. I travel so the ability to land 
at the airport and pop in a new SIM in whatever country I'm in & 
go makes life that much easier. Didn't really want to get rid of my Nexus 
4 but it was time for an upgrade and with this being LTE capable, it 
was a nice step up instead of going to the larger Nexus 6. Can't seem 
to put this phone down, find something new about it everyday!
