It was a Chinese clone of original Samsung product. It worked only for a year. 
As stated in advertisement, seller claimed it as a "Factory Unlocked International". When we came 
to India and tried to use this, it worked for few days and when tried 
to reset, if failed. So, it was not a " Factory Unlocked International". I advise 
everybody, not to purchase this model. Especially if it written made in china and not 
made in UK above the IMEI series is given below....< blank space >IMEI XYZXYZXYZXYZIMEI XYZXYZXYZXYZCamera 
quality was not good as well.
