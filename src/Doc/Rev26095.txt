This phone is fantastic, and exactly what I was looking for in a mid range 
phone. There are phones out there that are $100 more that do not offer anything 
more than this one does.Solid build, with a very clean, not bloated, installation of Marshmellow 
6.0.1, this phone is greate as my daily driver. and with 64GB of on board 
storage & 4 GB of ram, at $299, a fantastic deal.
