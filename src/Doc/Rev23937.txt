I received this iPhone 4 and checked it out as soon as i unboxed it, 
the screen was in perfect condition and the back of the phone was pretty good 
too only one scratch in the glass, i noticed that the white water damage stickers 
were removed out of the headphone slot and the charging port. I activated this phone 
and it worked very well until last night it started to randomly shut down on 
me and now it will not come on at all or charge!! I received this 
phone straight from amazon warehouse so i thought it was a safe bet, whats going 
on amazon??? we have to do better than this! $260 for a lemon.
