I have had this phone for about four days, and I love it. I use 
the phone on a T-Mobile pre-paid plan (4G). I did a lot of research on 
the phone, before my purchase. I purchased one on Ebay, and when I received it, 
I found out it was a Huawei knockoff. I got my money back and purchased 
one from Amazon. The interface takes some getting use to, but it works fine. The 
only other issue I have is the keyboard for messenger, which I don't like. I 
started using TouchPal which is already loaded on the phone, however, it is a battery 
drainer. I like the fact the phone does not have a lot of bloatware also. 
The battery does last for days. I charged it on the first day and didn't 
have to charge it again until the fourth day. Amazing!
