This phone is not working as it should, no android market, and is in Arabic, 
is not a good phone ...........I'm disappointed with my purchase.It was approximately 4 hours looking 
at different phones and did not know which wanted to buy, after so much time 
searching I decided to buy the HTC SmartPhone Unlocked GSM Wildfire A3333 with Android OS, 
5 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, and Touch Screen - International Version with No U.S. Warranty (Black), 
as the price, and phone technology amazed me.When the phone came to my hands I 
discovered something:language and keyboard of the phone was in Arabic.and did not have the android 
market.I feel cheated by the seller, which should specify that. I previously had bought phone 
on Amazon and never had any problems of this type with my purchases and I 
feel very cheated.I do not want the phone does not work for what I want, 
if an android phone. Why? no android market?. I do not understand.I will continue with 
my claims and it is my right ...I know that Amazon is a serious and 
honest company that will not allow this kind of harmful things to their customers .....I'll 
wait a speedy and satisfactory solution for both
