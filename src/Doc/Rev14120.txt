I like the phone(BLU Energy X 2) especially because it does not have a cheap 
look; though I was scared when i ordered it because i did not really know 
what to expect...I feel I made a good choice finally. The battery life is also 
as good as the review says.I gave it 4 star because1.The screen touch response is 
a little slow, hardly noticeable.2.The phone charged well at first but from the 2nd attempt 
to charge the phone, the Charger's adapter has refused to get the power level above 
25% even when i left it charging over night. I had to start charging with 
my laptop using USB cord that came with the adapter (good that it is detachable).... 
I would just need to get a new adapter latter3. Finally, it was said to 
have 8GB internal but mine really had just 4.5GB (so i could only download a 
few apps) and i felt like they could have taken the 0.5GB off and wrote 
in the review that it was 4GB....but anyway, I guess I was expecting too much 
for that price...
