First let me say, I'm a Windows Insider person. I'm on the Fast Ring of 
Beta testing. My real phone is a Lumia 950 XL. The ones before it were 
also Windows. And the ones way before that were Android, all Motorola. So this is 
my first Apple phone. Because 3/4 of my family are Apple people...we won't go into 
why but I blame it on the schools...they use FaceTime a lot. So, hence, if 
I want to be part of the social circle I have to use Apple. As 
for the phone, it's an okay phone. I like Live Tiles better than static apps. 
I like the power of Windows 10 Mobile. Siri has nothing on Cortana. Microsoft phones 
are durable and work as well as any with Apple's reputation. So I usually only 
use the iPhone on WiFi. But this certified refurbished phone works and works consistently. My 
one big complaint is it uses a Micro SIM instead of a Nano SIM. I 
can't swap SIMs to use cellular service on my main number. I bought this one 
for the extraordinary price. But I see another, Nano SIM model, certified refurbished iPhone in 
my future. Unless, of course, Apple decides to share FaceTime and iTunes with other platforms 
like Microsoft shares Office, Skype, Wunderlist, and many other apps with it's competitors. BTW I'm 
what would be considered an elderly woman and not some IT professional.
