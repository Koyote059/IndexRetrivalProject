Hello. i would give this phone a 5 star review, everything works except for the 
TON of bloatware that was installed right out of the box.3 antivirus software, Useless Apps, 
suspicious software and all the LG software as well.This phone had so much trash that 
I only had 300 mb left in RAM and I havent installed any of my 
apps. I spent around 2 hours disabling and trying to uninstall all the bloatware. I 
still have some lag while using the phone but after all the effort the phone 
works fine now.
