The days of $500+ to get a decent size and performing phones is now at 
an end. Nowadays, we are now greeted with a device that is affordable, practical, and 
beautiful. BLUâs latest product is all of that: functional, useful and a beauty to behold. 
This is just an initial impression of the the product, and I will update this 
review after I have more experience with the product. Note that the price ($349.99) is 
always a big factor for saying why such is Plus or Minus, and these may 
change after a week or so.FULL DISCLOSURE: I PREODER THIS WITH MY OWN MONEY, BEFORE 
ANY OF THE REAL REVIEWS ARE POSTED.Specs:= 2.0GHz MTK6795 Helio X10 64bit Octa-Core CPU= PowerVR

6â display+ Great Battery Life+ Fluid UI Performance+ Expandable Storage+ Decent Earphones+ Comes with Screen 
Protector, Clear Case, and Flip Cover Case+ NFC Stickers!Minus (What I Don't Like)- Cluttered Screen 
Design- No FM Radio- Combined Internal and SD Storage Management (can't auto-assign App installation and 
media storage to SD Card)- Flip Cover looks cheaply made (subjective taste so YMMV)- Long 
list of pre-set APN may conflict with DATA connectivityImprovement Required (Wish List):* More RAM (4GB)* 
Support for more LTE bands* Better Software Support i.e. future upgrade to Marshmallow* Would have 
been nice if screen protector comes pre-installedEarly Verdict â To Be Updated After More Experience 
and Play Time:The Phone is nicely done. The screen is vivid and very colorful. The 
sound is loud and clear and can be heard easily even at noisy environment. Voice 
audio is clear and SpeedTest on WiFI and mobile are within expectations. I like how 
the phone feels, it has a hefty weight and it look expensive. However, the free 
Flip Cover is not as good looking but it's a personal taste rather than being 
a truly ugly one. Aside from the Flip Cover, the product also comes with other 
add-on stuff which is a great bonus: earphones, three NFC stickers, screen protector, and a 
soft rubber case. It has plenty of storage, and it can be expanded to accommodate 
for more. FingerPrint sensor is quick and responsive, it's easy to use, and never failed 
to recognize me.The GPS is also quick to identify my location, and maintains good signal. 
I have tested the GPS for a short drive around my community, and it's accurate 
enough for me to trust this. Multi-tasking seems great, and gaming is lag free playing 
DISNEY Tsum Tsum. I have yet to test the picture quality as well as video 
call functionality, but for me, this is not a priority.I will continue to test drive 
this device for a week and check whether it meets my needs. Each and every 
person has different taste and requirements, so my own experience will vary greatly with others.For 
now, I have some "user issues" (meaning, it's not a product issue) that I need 
to discover as I learn more about the product. For example, I can't find a 
way to set the default app installation to SD Card, and to default save Pictures 
to SD card. In other Android phones I used (Zenfone 2, BLU Studio 7 II, 
etc) , I can easily find it. I also don't know yet on how to 
change the design when using the Flip Cover. I can't find an FM Radio app 
so it can very well be installed but I just can't find the app or 
way to activate it. These are not deal breaker for me, and I may still 
just be missing where these options are. So as of this moment, all CONS that 
I find will be treated with a grain of salt.And for those who might have 
problems with DATA connectivity, what works for me is to delete ALL preset APNs or 
just leave one only (it can be easily restored later if needed). Just This ensures 
less conflict and easier management of APNs. Put the correct APN settings on that single 
APN profile and DATA connectivity should be fast and smooth.Temporarily at 5Stars, will change rating 
depending if and when I found any issues. It is unfair to give this product 
anything less if I can not be sure that what I am having is a 
product issue or a user issue. At least for now, I am confident that the 
issues I am having are those of my own.
