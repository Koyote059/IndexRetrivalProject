Got this for my brother who wanted an android phone but didn't want to pay 
$650 for one. It says it supports 4g but when we got it only 3g 
worked. THEN there was a software update only a few days after he got it 
and it's 4g enabled! He doesn't have one complaint about this phone. No reason to 
spend hundreds more for a smartphone because this one is great.
