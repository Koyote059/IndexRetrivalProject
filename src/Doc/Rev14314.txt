It's a very great device. I was a bit skeptical purchasing this because it came 
out in 2013, but I am not a big fan of the iPhone 6 it 
feels weird in my in my hands. Nevertheless, the iPhone 5s fits my needs it 
is very fast with a 64 bit processor (this really helps with games and day 
to day usage). I really recommend this phone if you are looking for a speedy, 
affordable, and usage with one hand. But before you purchase you should really look at 
technical reviews of this phone they may be worth your while many of them show 
day to day usage. But if you are a little bit more technical and understand 
benchmark performance tests I.E. Antutu, geekbench etc... These will show it's raw performance (if you 
understand the numbers) if you don't it's fine the simplest way I can put it 
is higher is better.Also I want to say which seller I bought it from not 
really sure if they have any more in stock but I bought from textbook rush. 
They had very quick delivery I got it in 3 business days.
