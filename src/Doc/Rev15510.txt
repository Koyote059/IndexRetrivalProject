Everything was PERFECT. Came FOUR days earlier than estimated arrival date. Descroption said that there 
were minor scratches when screen is off but I had to look VERY closely to 
see them. I was nervous at first though because AFTER I bought it I read 
more reviews and people were saying that they couldn't activate the phone due to an 
outstanding balance but I went to T-Mobile and there wa nothing wrong!! VERY VERY HAPPY.
