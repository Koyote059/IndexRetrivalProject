This phone is definitely one of the fastest on the market at the moment. I 
have dropped it several times on hard floors, and there is no visible damage at 
all. I have also handled it with wet hands, and it still works flawlessly. Although, 
the fingerprint scanner doesn't get along with water drips. The edge screen is a great 
addition, and I have gotten use out of the news feature when the phone is 
locked. The battery life is great, since it lasts about a day with moderate to 
heavy use.Also, for those who are wondering, this model supports most LTE bands, and it 
is also supported by most GSM carriers. I use it with Metro PCS, and it 
works perfectly.
