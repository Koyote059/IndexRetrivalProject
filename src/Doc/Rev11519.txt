Battery was shot, browser glitches out never fully loads a page. Internal memory is crap 
never keeps my place on anything. Won't accept messages or phone calls randomly. It's not 
a network issue it's the phone I've checked. Tiny screen. My regular first generation Evo 
was head and shoulders above this thing.
