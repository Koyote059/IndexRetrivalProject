I bought this phone for cheap, and then once I landed in Germany I went 
to a shop in the Airport and bought the 9c/min Blau.de card. Then I had 
a phone that works all over Europe for calls and texts. What a life saver. 
Worked great all over Europe. No reception problems. People on the other end reported no 
issues.The phone works great. It's got everything you need in a basic phone plus an 
FM tuner. Much simpler than trying to buy one of the "Unlocked" phones on eBay 
or even worse form your wireless carrier in the US. Definitely better than paying on 
your US data plan.
