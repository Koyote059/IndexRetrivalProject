It's an awesome phone. The edge takes a little getting used to, but that's a 
small issue. Great camera, awesome sound in music and talking. Love the anti-glare. Seriously no 
glare from any angle. Even the headphones were great. Clear, crisp sounds. I bought the 
unlocked version and it works perfectly. Just had to insert the sim card and that 
was it. (And that's in the Caribbean) so for those customers wandering, it's definitely an 
Unlocked International Version. Highly recommended.
