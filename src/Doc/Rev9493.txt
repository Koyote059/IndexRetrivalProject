I've had this phone for about two weeks now, and I really don't have anything 
great to say about it. Granted, I bought this after my iPhone 5 died, and 
I'm not comparing the two, but I am biased because I'm used to a flagship 
quality.camera: The camera quality is absolute crap, and the built in filters make you look 
absolutely terrifying. I'm talking eyes 1/3rd the size of your face, giant pupils, and a 
head that looks like a giant white triangle.Display: I had to set my wallpaper to 
a black background because the display is so... I don't know the word. It looks 
pixel-y and generally ugly.Body: Not badly built, with a very durable screen and body. The 
case and screen protector it comes with are a total plus. It doesn't look like 
a cheap phone, and it isn't heavy either. Also thin, and I like the large 
screen.Speed: Multitasking isn't bad either. I sometimes would press an app and there would be 
no response for a good 2 seconds, but never more than three.Storage: The expandable storage 
is a plus for sure, along with the removable back and replaceable battery. There is 
quite a bit of bloatware installed on it, such as the kindle appstore.Battery: The battery 
life is really really great. I use it all day starting at 6am and I 
get home around 8:30pm, with somewhere around 30-45% left.Keyboard: This keyboard is AWFULLL I just 
hate it. Not very responsive and it takes up too much of the screen while 
you are typing.Overall: I would only recommend this phone if you are upgrading your kid/yourself 
from a flip phone, and you want to test something out to see if they 
can handle more technology. This phone has nothing great about it, and I'm only keeping 
it until I buy the Xiaomi redmi note 3.
