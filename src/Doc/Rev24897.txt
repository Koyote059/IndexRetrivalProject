I like the color of the phone (orange). It is easy friendly to operate. So 
far my only disappointment is the camera. It has a 8mp back camera and a 
2mp front facing camera. The pictures are lousy. The still pictures are grainy, fuzzy, and 
blurry and there isn't any way to correct it. I searched for a phone with 
a lot of megapixel so I can do video chat with my 2 yr old 
granddaughter who lives out of states. I can't do it because the video is so 
terrible. Very disappointed.
