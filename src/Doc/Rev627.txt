PRO:*Perfect size: not too big to be cumbersome, not too small to squint at.*Speedy: even 
with the bloatware, as long as you never use it...*Easy to Root: with either ZergRush 
or SuperOneClick.CON:*Battery: I'm conservative for the most part. But if you're using Wi-Fi to surf 
the web, have some tunes cranked to about 7, and have lowest brightness on, you 
can still drive it down to 10% in about 6 hours.*Bloatware: AND HOW. Still trying 
to see what's safe to kill off.I haven't activated it yet, so I can't tell 
you much about T-Mobile's service on this phone, but from the signal it's getting(for emergency 
calls), it's better than AT&T in some of my most common places(Columbia, SC and surrounding 
area)I'll be sure to update this review with signal tests and my opinion of the 
service.UPDATE 02/09/12: SimpleWiiController is probably the only app I could not get working... Which is 
a shame. A Wii Remote makes play Sonic CD so much easier.UPDATE 02/22/12: I've activated 
the phone on 2/17/12. T-Mobile's coverage is a little under par at home, floating around 
2 bars. At school, I have full strength. Haven't had it drop down to EDGE 
except down Hwy 1 near Lexington, SC last Saturday. The speeds I can't really complain 
about, the highest I've tested with Ookla's SpeedTest.net app was 5.73 Mbps. The max data 
rate this phone can handle over HSPA is 14.4 Mbps, so I'll keep testing to 
see if there's improvement.Can't speak much to call quality because:1.It's not what I bought the 
phone for2. I don't speak much on the phone.The 7 minutes I've spent so far 
though sounded much better than my old phone(LG Prime on AT&T), almost as good as 
my older Verizon phone(Samsung Intensity).
