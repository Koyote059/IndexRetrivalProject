Overall this is a nice phone, but when you turn on the speaker phone the 
sound is very muffled as if something is covering up the speakers.For some reason or 
another I can not receive any signal inside of my apartment. And I have the 
internet, they do not send you a brochure explaining the features that are on the 
phone. I would really like my money back , because I am not satisfied at 
all with something I have to basically figure out how to use it. Most phones 
when purchased will have a little manual letting you know about the phone. Not this 
one.
