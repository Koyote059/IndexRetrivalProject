I ordered this phone according to the 4.5 and 5 star reviews. I purchased it 
in November 2015 and it is now December 2015 and the phone cannot hold a 
charge; dies easily. I have charged it overnight for about a month with no problems. 
Then on Christmas Eve, I woke up and the first time since I have had 
the phone, it was dead and I could not get it turned on - it 
had died and unable to get it to charge. The only things I use my 
phone for, phone calls, texting, little internet usage when I want to look up something 
while on the road, and monitoring my webcams. The provider removed the battery - looked 
the phone over and had to charge it for me at their location. I left 
there and the same day in the evening, the phone was unable to keep charged 
up even after charging on the portable charger and through the wall socket. I am 
very disappointed that the phone cannot hold a charge. I do not recommend purchasing this 
phone. I would not give it any stars because the cell phone's performance is extremely 
poor, but I had to give it at least 1 star.
