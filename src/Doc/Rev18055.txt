The device performs well apart from the fact that its battery runs out pretty quickly. 
Also the seller has not provided any warranty. The seller said it was not branded 
but it does have AT&T logo and stuff in it. You may as well just 
buy it from the microsoft store( for the same price) coz in that way you 
will get the same product but with warranty.
