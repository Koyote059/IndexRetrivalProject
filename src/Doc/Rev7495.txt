This phone is the worst! The only thing good about it was the price but 
hey "you get what you pay for". I basically just needed a backup phone so 
that's just what it is... It always stop! Seem like no app is compatible and 
they all keep stopping. I have to go to a blank screen to talk on 
the phone because it goes to the dial pad and mute the phone. Omg it's 
just so much lol -_-
