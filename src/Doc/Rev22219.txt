Absolutely love it! Battery easily lasts all day. Sometimes 2 if you don't use it 
much. I can usually get about 4 hours of screen on time. Coming from a 
nexus 5 that could barely get 2.5 that's impressive. D5803 version works great in US 
on ATT. No problems. I had to cut my SIM card down to size as 
well and that also works fine. No problems.
