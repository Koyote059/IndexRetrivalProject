I was pleasantly surprised at the performance of this phone absolutely brilliant. I traveled to 
Africa purchased a sim card there inserted it in the phone it worked. Next stop 
was United kingdom repeated same process with a sim card purchased there it worked. I 
am recommending this phone to anyone looking for unlocked phones that actually functions to it's 
specifications. As for Looks it's just a typical android standard appearance no frills or thrills.
