The phone looks good. I purchased it as a gift and unfortunately it didn't arrive 
before the individual left. I have the M8 and I love it. This phone is 
missing one of the key features that I love about my M8. This phone doesn't 
have the feature that allows you to toggle between previously opened screens. You can only 
go to the home screen and back. That was stupid of the designers to take 
that feature out especially when the Samsung phones offer that feature. If you want to 
compete with Samsung you can't just increase the size of your phone, you also have 
to include nice features.
