I've had this watch for a few days now. It synced to my android just 
fine. Downloaded the app for phone with the qr code. Fit is comfortable. I have 
small wrists and it isn't so huge it bothers me, don't notice it really. All 
notifications work well. When I get a notification it plays my phone ringtone, so both 
this and my phone are babbling minions till I check it. The sleep monitor works 
fine. Only tried that once so idk how true but for last night being as 
I didn't sleep it said poor, seems right. The pedometer works well but is a 
little slow. Takes a few to catch up. Texts messages come threw fine and you 
can reply to them. Phone calls come threw but i have not been able to 
talk on it due to interference with something else in my home (possibly other Bluetooth 
devices interfering). Browser, remote capture, image viewer and audio player I cannot get to function. 
I've sent an email to the company due to this not really having instructions. There 
was some but didn't have much info. So overall this is a good starter watch 
for someone wanting to try a smart watch, which is why I bought it. It 
works ok for the price. (Will add more on email reply from company)
