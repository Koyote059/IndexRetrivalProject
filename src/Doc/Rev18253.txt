DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! Battery life is only a few hours. The charger doesn't 
fit in the phone properly so you have to McGiver it to get the charger 
to stay in place so it will charge. Photo quality is poor. Phone keeps shutting 
off on me, even when I have a full charge. Then it is difficult to 
turn back on. Its hard to hear on and it's hard for others to hear 
you. Over all a HUGE disappointment. I called to report the problems and they told 
me it needed a factory reset. So I reset it. Nothing changed.
