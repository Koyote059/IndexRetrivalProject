3.5 hours on the stock charger and my brand new phones battery is too low 
to boot ??? Well, i guess its my fault for buying a cheaper Chinese sweat 
shop phone. Should have just bought the S7. You get what you pay for. I 
remember buying my S2. Stuck the sim card in, hit the power ... and , 
guess what ? It boots right up. 5 years old and that's the phone i 
was looking to replace. Still works perfect. Well, i guess I'll put the sim card 
back in it. How do i get my money back for this "Flagship Killer" ? 
I bought this piece of garbage from Amazon but maybe it will just be easier 
to do a charge back through PayPal. Thanks for your help.
