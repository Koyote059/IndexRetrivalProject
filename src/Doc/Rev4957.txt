The rubber outside it made better than the one I bought 2 years ago for 
my Galaxy S2. However, it is a lot tighter than the old one, which is 
good when keeping dirt out from in between the screen and the cover, but it's 
so tight that it pushes up against the screen and causes the same effect as 
pushing on your computer monitor.
