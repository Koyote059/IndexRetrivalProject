Works well, but the manual has a tiny print that you need a magnify glass, 
and does not explain everything. I bought it for my son, he is able to 
figure things out. I myself have trouble making a simple call on it. I enter 
a number and it gives me a different contact. But he likes it, that's all 
that matters.
