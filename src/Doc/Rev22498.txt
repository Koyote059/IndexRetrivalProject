I love my cell. Then 2 months later it has decided to stop charging. Seems 
the charger port is lacking big time with this model from what I read now. 
It was very hard to find anyone to even work on my cell given that 
the brand is Blu. Once I did finally find someone it was going to have 
to be mailed in because I live to far way from them. When its all 
said and done it will cost $75.00 just to fix and mail it back. :(I 
love the cell but with that price to fix it. It doesn't seem worth it.
