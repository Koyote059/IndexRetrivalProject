Works as expected. I purchased a pre-owned Samsung Galaxy S4. The SIM card had been 
removed by the previous owner, and the phone wouldn't do anything without a SIM card 
installed. Seeking to avoid a trip to Verizon and the hassle of trying to glom 
a SIM card from them, I purchased this one for under $6. The SIM card 
installed easily in the back of the phone, just above the battery, and was immediately 
recognized by the phone which displayed a bright red Verizon logo on the display. I 
am yest to activate my Samsung Galaxy, but am able to now use the device's 
features like the camera, and also download apps, so long as I am connected to 
wi-fi. So far, no issues with this SIM card. if you need one, I recommend 
this one.
