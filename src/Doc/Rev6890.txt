The phone service and five star is OK. The camera can only be used to 
take photos to send by email or upload to social media at $0.25 each. They 
cannot be directly copied to your computer from the phone which makes the camera useless 
to me.They should allow you to email the photos to yourself without additional cost. If 
you want text messages blocked you must call them to put a block on your 
number otherwise you could be charged for text messages sent by others to you even 
if they are not from people you know.
