Phone with many issue. For one thing, not all the letters work when texting. Randomly 
switches screens. I'm not a high tech person and tried to live with it...ended up 
being so frustrated I turned it off and filed claim. However claim was a few 
days past 30 day guarantee and GizmoTraders wouldn't exchange it. SHAME ON AMAZON TOO because 
they advertised 90 day A to Z guarantee on this product which of course led 
me to believe they would guarantee a good resolution for problems of defective merchandise but 
that was not the case! They said said claim filed after 30 days...OUT OF LUCK 
and see our fine print!
