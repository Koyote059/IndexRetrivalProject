I purchased this phone for my husband. He has a very hard time keeping phones 
intact due to work. I'd give it a 2.5 . It's very bad at holding 
GPS signal and trouble with text messages. He has to frequently reboot the phone. It 
is definitely durable. He drove away with it on the top of his truck and 
went back to it intact. Very poor quality of an android though.
