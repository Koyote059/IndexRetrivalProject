I got the Moto G Play because I needed a smartphone for work. For me 
an unlocked smartphone was a good alternative. The product arrived on time and it was 
in very good shape. I was able to insert the battery and get it charged 
quickly. My carrier sent me a SIM card and it was able to work immediately. 
Both the Micro SD card and the SIM card were very easy to install. My 
old phone never worked in my home and the new Moto G Play was able 
to get a signal in my home. It will take a while to get familiar 
with all the apps but I am very satisfied with the phone and emails. I 
really don't need the other functions for now.Good points:Phone is very good. It is fairly 
responsive and it does the job. As for apps, I just have the basics and 
they are very easy to use.I don't mind the Amazon ads at all.Long battery life.Fairly 
easy to use.Pictures are fairly high resolution.Bad points:This is not a Motorola phone. It is 
a Lenovo phone. I thought it was a Motorola product.Privacy: Expect to give up most 
of your privacy. Google wants access to everything (contacts, pictures, emails and everything else). Even 
if you deny it access it keeps annoying you that it needs access for a 
better user experience.Updates: The latest version of Android is called Nougat. I don't know when 
that will be available for this phone.Google updates its own apps by itself whether you 
want it or not.Summary: It ain't no iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, but it is a 
very reasonable phone for a $100.00. All total the final price will be about $150.00. 
Phone was a $100.00. Sim Card was $21.00. The Micro SD card I got on 
sale for $4.00. The carrying case and glass film I also got on sale for 
$25.00.
