Have had for a couple weeks and things are running great on metro PS. Uses 
a micro sim I already had in my old phone. I went to the store 
paid for them to activate it was 15$. Much better than the grand prime I 
was using. The rate it processes and switches between apps. Much better features and no 
lag. Screen is large and clear. I love it
