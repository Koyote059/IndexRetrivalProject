Gotta say that if you want a brand new phone both in and out including 
the packing and charging adapter ,get it from the official place, not here. But if 
you want a g3 that is fully functional and phone it self is brand new 
not charger and so on, buy it here. The phone is perfect,I think it is 
bearly touched, but it is open-boxed, and the box is not the origional once( i 
got a white version and it came with a gold opened box which looked old 
and a korea version charger. The phone is brand new american version, supposed to be 
brand new as i think at this point. So phone itself is perfect. The other 
details, meh......after all its the phone that matters. I guess the 70 bucks short for 
a reason. Dispite that, this is perfect. Ps: I do think this is the best 
android phone out there u can buy. Will u notice the difference of 4k display? 
Yes u will. Nothin is better. Hope this helps your desicion making. Peace
