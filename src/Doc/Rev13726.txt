Absolutely amazed by Huawei ... in a very bad way. The worst customer service I've 
ever experienced. My wife has had multiple problems with this phone and had to send 
it for repairs twice.This time, she asked for help with a very simple issue (finding 
out whether they were shipping back her repaired phone or replacing it with a new 
one) and was told by customer service reps that they couldn't provide any information. Each 
time she called, they said managers were too busy to talk with her, but promised 
a call back, which never happened.Finally, she got an email from a manager (but no 
phone call), which said: "If you have any other questions please email me directly. The 
call center agents will no longer be able to provide any other information." So she 
emailed back, and the manager ignored her.Do you think Apple, Google, LG, or Samsung blacklist 
their customers and forbid them to call customer service?Be warned: Never, ever, ever buy anything 
from Huawei.
