This phone was a disappointment.Proximity sensor seems to be stuck, the screen goes black whenever 
a call comes in even without it being raised to the ear. So you have 
to lock and unlock the screen to end the call.Some of the settings seem to 
be separate apps because when you go back they close right out of settings rather 
than going back to the main settings view.Hotspot needed to playing with to get working. 
It wouldn't save the APN setting.Bluetooth doesn't connect to my car.The curved screen makes typing 
annoying.The physical keyboard keys are too small and close for my figures.The blackberry apps still 
have some maturing to go through before they are a positive layer to the Android 
experience, but they're not bad.The only thing is has going for it is that its 
a trusted name in security, but after you install all your apps that security is 
greatly diminished. Cyanogenmod gives more control in the security area, they should consider using that 
as their base.
