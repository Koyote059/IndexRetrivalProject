This is my first Android phone and there are a lot of nice things and 
a few quirky things I don't care for. Camera and speakers are excellent. Battery life 
is 50% of what I thought it would be as soon as you turn on 
any location services. The battery is well short of what I would expect. I would 
have taken a fatter phone for a better battery. Second, and most annoying, is that 
when you are on a call the power button hangs up the phone. So if 
you want to shut the screen off to save battery and you press the power 
button like you would normally do, you hang up the phone. This just wastes battery. 
Size, weight, feel, speed HTC platform is all excellent. I have noticed dropped calls but 
that could be ATT service and not the phone.
