We received this phone today and even though it came 2 days late which was 
completely UPS's fault not the seller or Amazon, we absolutely love this phone. Flawless to 
say the least. Running newest version of android and we can't put it down. Only 
thing I would let future customers know is that you have to go into settings 
to activate your data.
