I loved my original Palm Pre. So when it was beat up after two years 
of use (dropped it so many times), I decided to get another Palm. I've had 
the Palm Pre 2 for about a year and a half, and I can't really 
say that I like it.Neutral:-It's an older smart phone so it will look different and 
more unique than the current phones. I was actually fine with being different... Until recently 
where a co-worker just blasted me out on having a "stone-age phone". She said the 
word "palm" with disgust and disbelief. It made me feel like sh*t.Cons:-Overall, the phone is 
buggy.-A lot of dropped calls.-Apps/features will work when they want to. Like picture texting.-The phone 
overheats easily.-The phone does this thing where it auto-restarts itself. I don't know how, or 
why. But it's like this: I'm just ABOUT to do something and it turns dark 
and restarts. If I'm on a call, the screen will still restart without effecting my 
call though. It's annoying as heck because I swear it does it when I REALLY 
need to do something.-The qwerty key is not as good as the original Palm. Sometimes 
I even miss letters.I wouldn't get this phone again. And I probably won't get another 
Palm. It's just sooooo slow and buggy.
