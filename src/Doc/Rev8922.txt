The phone has its ups and downs. The ups is it looks good and feels 
good, now the downs this phone lags so much that you have no choice but 
to get used to it, this happens almost all the time. It freezes also but 
not as much as it lags. THIS PHONE is soo annoying because after a while 
of using, since i use wifi and not 4G LTE, this phone will think that 
i have no internet connection for apps when i can have all 5 bars (or 
4 or whatever it have) but the point is that i could have a strong 
signal but apps like youtube, google play, etc. will say NO CONNECTION. And the only 
way to fix it is to do a factory reset deleting everything which so painful. 
Also since the phone is old, some apps will not work or can be downloaded 
and god forbid you get a 3d game. it will lag to the point where 
you have to remove the battery or wait for it to reset itself. PLEASE save 
yourself from this phone dont get, and if you do be ready. The only reason 
i gave it three stars is because of the seller. This is the first time 
i have had a bad experience because usally i dont know why some people put 
bad reviews on some stuff that i dont have problems with , but THIS, THIS 
need a warning. Save up money for another or get a phone with a contract 
not this. i have a samsung facinate before this and that worked better than this 
and i say that because this phone the samsung droid charge came out 5 MONTHS 
after the facinate, so you would think it would do better than the facinate right, 
WRONG!!!!
