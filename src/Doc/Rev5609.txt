I purchased the phone in February. It worked super great. Loved the camera, loved the 
options and all my apps. I was super careful with it. Then one day in 
May the screen stopped working. I tried all the possible sollutions. I even contacted the 
seller to ask about the warranty. BUT, I never got a simple responce from the 
seller :( Then I called the customer service and found out that the phone didn't 
have a warranty in the US... To repair the screen will be from 150$ and 
up...and from all the research I've done so far - it's a common thing for 
Nokia Lumia 1020 to have such issues... Next time, it would be nice, if the 
seller notifies the customer, that the expensive purchase they are about to make will not 
be covered by the factory warranty...So 1 star is to the seller and 2 stars 
to the phone itself because of the issue.
