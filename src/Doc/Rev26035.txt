I really liked the keyboard, and the larger screen, but I didn't like the extra 
weight, or the dimensions of this phone. I simply doesn't feel as nice to hold 
or easy to hold with ease as the N8. It is also much heavier than 
the N8. It would've been nice if Nokia found a way to lighten up the 
phone maybe with carbon fiber or even polycarbonate composite. Aluminum is a thing of the 
past, too heavy, and easy to ding up. The biggest disappointment is the firmware/os. It 
simply wasn't ready for prime time or release. It was too buggy and constantly required 
power-off to reset. I was unable to end calls or press to take calls since 
Nokia chose to take the "talk" button away... a very not smart move. I also 
experienced frequent lock ups, in any case it was more buggy than the N8 even 
though they both use symbian os.... who knows.... I wish it was better, Nokia support 
was not helpful... too green and not knowledgeable enough to be useful. I would look 
to the next generation nokia phones running Symbian Anna due out July-August timeframe
