Received my phone 3 months ago, AFTER the first one got lost in transit, then 
had to replace the second one because after a month of use it refused to 
charge, charger wouldn't sit nicely in the port...I take very good care of all my 
device so both phones are in pristine condition and yet both had the same problem, 
I am not returning the third phone after only 3 weeks of use because once 
again the charger practically falls out of the port so I am unable to charge 
it even after changing multiple chargers....if not for this major issue I would love the 
phone as the technology on it is great, pop ups sorta suck occasionally but the 
hardware needs more attention... back to iPhone as I've never had issues with them...
