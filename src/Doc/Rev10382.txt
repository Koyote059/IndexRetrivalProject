I'm an avid hikker and have used different sattelite phones in my many treks. From 
Globalstar to Iridium, I've used them all. All of them usually required a spot were 
the signal was good and to be very still. I have used this phone from 
a moving car while crossing over the Andes with very good reception. I have also 
used it in the middle of the desert in Peru, in a hike over the 
Callejon de Huaylas in Peru and in the middle of nowhere in Costa Rica. I'm 
very happy with this phone.
