I have owned and loved Nokia phones forever it seems. After my N8 purchase, I 
was tired of many bugs, and mad at Nokia for waiting ages for Anna update 
to see it later fail every installation with useless help from their technical support - 
I had to install all components manually based on Nokia blog tips. However, My wife's 
old Nokia 5800 died and she wanted a new phone. Since I only buy unlocked 
phones (we use them a lot overseas with different SIM cards) I did not have 
too many inexpensive choices. She needed a phone that would give her GPS, free maps 
and voice guidance without data access, and for than Nokias are the only game in 
town. When she got this phone something was not installed properly and her contacts would 
not even start up. After a lot of struggle I decided to do a hard 
reset (not a soft factory reset, which did not work) and it started working fine. 
Since then she has loved it. She does a lot of texting and keyboard works 
great for her (I hate it). She likes the white version that sets it apart 
from all the blackberries. I take one star off for getting brand new phone with 
one of the main apps not starting up.
