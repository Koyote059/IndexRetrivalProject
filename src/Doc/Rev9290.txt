Love the S5. I bought an unlocked 'Verizon' phone that did not work at first 
on my ATT plan; but ATT chat help gave me the correct data to put 
in the VPN settings and got that working. Then, I could not get Google Playstore 
(and thus, no apps) and Best Buy Geek Squad (they are awesome!) trouble shot with 
me and we finally updated the Android jellybean operating system and I got it! Now 
the phone works great. Takes excellent pictures too. I had the S3 and loved the 
size as it fit in side pockets and my clutch I carry -- S5 is 
a wee bit bigger, but it still works.
