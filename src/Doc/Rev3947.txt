As far as the phone itself goes. It's great! It's no Samsung Galaxy or HTC 
EVO , or whatever high end smartphone you want to name... But it is a 
great little phone for the price tag. It was received in a non sealed box 
( inside the sealed shipping package of course ) . The battery was fully charged 
( not in phone ) and the phone already has Android OS 2.1 installed on 
it. Leading me to believe that it's perhaps refurbished or "pre-prepared" as you can get 
these phones like that at some retail stores... But none the less, the phone is 
scratch free complete with protective film on front back and edges. The phone is quick 
and lag free even after i loaded it up with apps. I have no complains 
on the performance of this phone.** I knew this going in.. but some of you 
may not have done your research. So let me shed some insight on using this 
phone in the US. **You have 2 GSM providers to choose from in the US 
T-Mobile and AT&T ( all other GSM providers you might find in the US are 
piggybacking off of the AT&T or T-Mobile network and use the same 3G frequencies ) 
- Both of these providers are using dual bands for their 3g UTMS frequencies : 
AT&T uses 850Mhz / 1900Mhz - and T-Mobile uses 900Mhz / 2100mhz . This Phone 
does support these frequencies , but only the BASIC GSM frequencies . But when you 
are talking 3g signals, Your unlocked phone needs to have support for both frequencies as 
UTMS that your US GMS provider requires in order to pick up their 3g signal. 
And you can see that this phone only supports UTMS 900/2100 dual. So getting a 
3g signal in the US on this phone is simply impossible. You'll be stuck on 
2G/EDGEHOWEVER..... What this phone is great for , is 3G connection on almost every other 
continent except for North America. In Europe and Asia this phone will grab a 3g 
signal the moment you land in the country ( provided you have an active SIM 
from that country) . Reason being is because most countries outside of US, Canada and 
Mexico all have a single UTMS frequency for their 3G.. which is 2100Mhz ... So 
Therefore this is a great phone to use while traveling abroad, if you're concerned about 
getting a 3G connection while your in Japan on vacation for example.
