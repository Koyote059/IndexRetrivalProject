This is a great phone all around tough phone but not to great for the 
water part but can't complain for the price and received it really fast two days. 
Way better than all the I phones I've had pos apple and almost went to 
at&t to pay out the ass for a galaxy note4 $800 and a two year 
contract f that noise get this phone it does the job both me and my 
wife have same exact phones. Only cons are not so loud speaker phone and when 
ever you hit spacebar you sometimes hit home button and back out of whatever your 
typing but hay for the price its awesome phone.
