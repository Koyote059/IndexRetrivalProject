It's just an extension of your iPhone on your wrist. It will help you track 
your activity and fitness goals. Lots of ways to configure it. Buy it if you 
like gadgets. No way this is a necessity. As a watch, its biggest draw back 
is its battery life. It requires daily charging. I personally value the find my iPhone 
feature the most. Very handy when you misplace your iPhone. It's very gimmicky. Using the 
speaker phone will surely distinguish you as a Nerd through and through.
