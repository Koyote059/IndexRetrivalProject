the phone is not new, i got a used phone and on top of that 
the screen has been replaced, i guess by looking at the entire edge of the 
screen and see glue all around it. the crystal that protects the back camera has 
scratches. not even my one year old g3 is this bad. really the crapiest "new 
phone" i have ever got.
