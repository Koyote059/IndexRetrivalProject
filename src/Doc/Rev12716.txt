The phone delivered to me is a Samsung phone, but cannot be activated by Verizon. 
I ordered and paid for the phone because I needed a "NO CONTRACT VERIZON PHONE" 
to replace one my mother-in law broke. She is currently on my Verizon account, and 
I am currently under contract with Verizon. The model number and ESN tag on the 
phone Global Distributing sent me is obviously not the original tag, and has been replaced 
at some point in time. Regardless Verizon cannot activate phone, and says the tag on 
phone actually identifies it to be a Motorola phone.I have tried repeatedly and futilely to 
contact Global Distributing at (208) 391-5347 (phone number is number published under seller's information, and 
is also number given to me by Amazon's customer service). I have tried for 5 
days to contact Global Distributing, and have left several specific voice messages on their Google 
phone service. I have yet to receive the courtesy of a return phone call from 
anybody other than Amazon customer service.After involving Amazon customer service (best most responsive customer service 
I have ever dealt with), and receiving refund from Amazon I finally received an email 
from Global Distributing whinging about refuns.Global Distributing needs not to whine to Amazon about refunds, 
but needs to do the right and proper thing by contacting customers, returning phone calls, 
and selling proper products. No refund was requested by me, but was the last resort 
since Global Distributing refused to return my phone calls. I ordered and paid for this 
phone on April 6, 2013. It has been 10+ days, and I am no closer 
to having replacement phone in hand. I am disappointed in the response by Global Distributing. 
They need to treat their customers like customers.
