The Honor 8, beautiful phone in my opinion. It is almost perfect but it's not. 
There are some technical and physical cons that I'd like to address but first, let's 
start with the pros.Pros-Gorgeous design. I really like the design of this phone, it's elegant 
and eye-catching.-Performace, it's really snappy. I love how quick everything loads.-Display, even though I would 
prefer an AMOLED display, this display is pretty good and can hold it's ground.-Battery Life, 
it would last my a day and a half of regular use (so mix of 
youtube, texting, gaming, taking pictures, etc.)-The camera can take amazing pictures but there is a 
downside.-The phone feels extremely solid in the hand.-Fast charging charges the phone up in about 
1 and a half hours.Neutral-EMUI, I personally don't hate it but I wish they would 
stick with a more traditional android experience. It, however, is annoying that notifications don't show 
up on the lock screen.Cons-The camera's video capabilities aren't the greatest. It's decent but not 
great.-This phone uses Gorilla Glass 3 not 4. I wished Huawei would put this in 
the spec sheet on their website. I had to go ask an agent from Huawei 
in order to get this information.-I wish this phone uses quick charge 3.0 because there 
isn't any quick charge battery banks that support this phone which is disappointing.-For me, the 
GPS is gimmicky when I'm using it for the first few minutes but the problem 
goes away after those few minutes.-The phone only has 24.06 GB of storage even though 
it's advertised as 32 GB.Overall, the phone is great. For $322.98, it's a great deal. 
I got it on Black Friday for $265 with the free Doctor Strange bundle (case 
is pretty sick). I would recommend this phone to anyone that's looking for an amazing 
budget phone.
