Great phone for the price. No issues and functions as it should. Note to buyers 
that there are 2 versions of this phone, that have different bands, so make sure 
your carrier supports them. I use the US version on T-Mobile and it works great. 
Also a word of advice....some phone reviewer's on the web didn't give this phone a 
great rating, which is a little unfair. After all, this is a 130.00 phone, and 
not a 600.00 Flagship.
