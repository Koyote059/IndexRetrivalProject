5 Stars for the features/price ratio. Seriously amazing value here.Verizon does work for an >>already 
activated<< sim. I set up the phone with Tmobile and then popped in my Verizon 
iPhone 6 Plus sim (using an adapter) and it worked just great. SMS, MMS, and 
LTE data were no issue and required no configuration. It is wonderful having a backup 
phone again.GPS is fine - I used Waze over the weekend to get from DC 
to Cape Cod and back. No problem. Long drive!Display is great - resolution is fine.Amazon 
ads do not detract and are no big deal. I'll take the $50 savings, thank 
you very much.Two things that are not present. (1) Tmobile WiFi calling is not available 
(yes, you can use google hangouts, Skype, etc., and there are easy work arounds) because 
it is not baked into the OS. (2) The lack of a finger print reader 
makes using a password manager and some of the banking apps more awkward - this 
lack is something I missed more than I thought I would, but is certainly not 
a deal breaker at $99.
