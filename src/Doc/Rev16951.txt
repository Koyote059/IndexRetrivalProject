Windows 10 Mobile has come a long way since this phone has debuted. A year 
ago, the OS was slow, buggy and didn't have many apps to work with. Now 
it feels like this phone is a freaking powerhouse. The camera is outstanding, Continuum works 
flawlessly on a display dock, and the OS itself is slick, slick, slick. The new 
Android flagships from Samsung feel jittery and slow compared to this phone.
