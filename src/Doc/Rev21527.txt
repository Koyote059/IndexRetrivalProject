I've always loved the Nexus phones and I've owned a few of them. As usual 
it comes with the trade-offs that the cheap Nexus phones have always had, but this 
is nothing a Nexus user wouldn't know about.Performance is a bit slow: Seems like it's 
missing some RAM and CPU power for the latest Android version. Tends to slow down 
very quickly after a few hours, resetting the phone every few months help. I'd recommend 
to root it and use the Greenify app for automatic memory dumps.Storage is limited: I've 
been spoiled for using a 64 GB SD card. Going without it is a bit 
hard, but nothing that over the air backups can't fix.
