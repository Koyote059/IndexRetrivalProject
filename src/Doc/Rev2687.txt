At first I loved this phone. The price was great and I absolutely love the 
screen! Unfortunately that is where the good stopped. The GPS on this phone is pathetic 
to say the least. My 6 year old Sony Advance was better. As well I 
have never broken a phone screen until this phone. I dropped it once BOOM! My 
Nexus 5 has been dropped at least 6 times the same way with barely a 
scratch anywhere. Now I know that this could just be a coincidence but after looking 
at other reviews, I am not the only one thinking it is not. As well 
the replacement cost is well over 50% of the phone price. So I did not 
even consider it. The layout and interface of this Android are not all that smooth 
but that is not too big of deal. On the plus side the dual sim 
and ability to add extra memory is pretty awesome. All in all I do not 
believe this phone is worth the $200 US price tag.
