I bought this phone about a week ago to replace my LG Xenon, which broke. 
So far, I really like the LG Neon. It's so easy to use, and it 
isn't loaded with (what I find) unnecessary features. The QWERTY key board is great and 
a breeze to use.My only complaint is in regards to the camera and picture album. 
The camera quality is not great. Also, pictures I take are not put at the 
top of the album and I have to go searching for them. This may be 
because I have a microSD card in the phone, I don't know. Lastly, the picture 
album takes a while to load, and scrolling also takes a long time.This phone is 
not 3G capable, if that's what you are looking for. If you're looking for a 
hoity-toity phone, pass on the LG Neon.Bottom line is, I got what I was looking 
for, a user-friendly, simple, and inexpensive phone to use until my contract is up for 
an upgrade.
