My niece is 15 and so hard on phones, my sister has spent a ton 
of money replacing phones because at 15 years old the right phone matters. I was 
given the opportunity to try out the Juning 5" Android phone and passed it along 
to my niece because I knew it would be perfect for her.Starting with the obvious 
looks. Just by looks alone, it's amazing. It's Pink and that is something so different 
than the average phone you can get with a major carrier. It easily resembles a 
Samsung in size and button placement so she doesn't look "uncool" and the screen is 
BIG which is important as we all know.The phone easily connected to my homes wifi 
for set up and I was more than impressed with the speed of it. The 
quad core is very compatible to my iPhone 6s Plus but without the $750 price 
tag. It is up to date on android and had many features that my niece 
was looking for including a front facing camera for those snapchat selfies. There is plenty 
of space to download other apps from the Google play store once you get yourself 
set up too.It is a dual sim phone but my niece doesn't travel out of 
the country though if that's of importance to you having that extra SIM card port 
is amazing.**3G (WCDMA 850/2100) 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) **That is the specifics as far 
as what the phone is compatible with. We have T-Mobile and it worked with no 
issues or lag straight away when we popped her SIM card in. Keep in mind 
this is at 3G and 2G speeds, it is in no way compatible with 4G 
or 4G LTE services but as we all know, most companies throttle our data to 
2G after just a few gb and I hardly notice at all. I honestly noticed 
no lag at all in this phone at 3G or 2G speeds.The phones comes with 
a charger, earbuds, screen protector and a silicone case. I tried a Samsung lightening charger 
I had around the house but it didn't fast charge the phone. The ear buds 
are pretty meh.. Nothing amazing and the silicone case is better than nothing. My niece 
likes it because it is clear and shows off that she has a very unique 
pink phone. It seems like it provides better protection than none but I'm not sure 
where to find others since this is kind of a newer brand of phone.Overall, I'd 
say this is a great phone. It performs great and. For the price, you really 
can't beat all the kick you get in this Android phone. I'm an iPhone lover 
but my son is wanting one of these Junings for himself now too and they 
come in a variety of colors so maybe we will give it another go.I did 
receive this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review however that did not 
influence my opinion in any way.
