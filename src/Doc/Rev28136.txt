Phone seems to be in very good shape. The screen is scratch free as is 
most of the body. It is also clean. There is one small dent in the 
body of the phone right next to the lightening connector, but it is small and 
minor. I checked the IMEI number with Apple and this phone was given to someone 
less than 2 months ago as a warranty replacement under Applecare. So either it was 
likely used minimally and is basically an Apple refurb. 90 Day warranty from the seller 
is what we get and that is better than buying one from eBay. So far 
I am pleased, though the iPhone cable that came with it appears to be a 
fake and "is not supported."By the way, shipping from BuySPRY was EXTREMELY fast. I purchased 
on a Saturday night and it arrived before noon on Sunday with Prime shipping.
