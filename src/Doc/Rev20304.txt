As a person that recently got into the world of smart watches, I had to 
learn a lot in a short time.I'm writing this review while holding an iPhone because 
I haven't seen anyone do it. It does everything as described on the description, you 
can control your music (it basically works as a bluetooth speaker), answer phone calls, set 
an alarm, track your steps, and make calls. The only things that you can't do 
on an iPhone is get text, mail, and social media notifications, but if you have 
an android you should be fine. Overall the smart watch did perform to what I 
had expected which was good in my book.
