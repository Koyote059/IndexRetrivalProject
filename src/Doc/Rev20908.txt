I had a note 4 was going to upgrade to note 7 but decided to 
save money and got this phone. It has a huge screen and comes with android 
6.0. It does fast charging and has 2 screens in the front. This phone is 
quicker than my note 4.A small status screen on top of the main screen and 
the fingerprint button is in the back which makes it easier to unlock. I bought 
this phone from this seller because of the 90 day warranty. everyone else is usually 
30 days.
