I've had iPhones, Androids and windows phones. I actually like this phone more then all 
the others I've had. The operating system is a bit different from the others but 
Google will answer most questions easily. Built tough and looks very unique. It's not a 
smart phone but its almost there it comes out of the box with almost every 
thing I need. Installed my T-Mobile SIM card and it worked with no problems. 3 
days so far and I don't miss my smart phone. Im buying another one when 
I can so if they stop making this I have a extra to keep going 
with.
