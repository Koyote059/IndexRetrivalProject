First: The bad.I purchased this phone because my old phone, (a Sony Ericsson), broke. One 
week after I received the phone the internal screen broke/cracked on its own accord. I 
take amazing care of my phone and treat it with much TLC. I was very 
disappointed because Nokia phones are supposed to be the most durable and reliable. I talked 
to Amazon.com and they replaced it for free because it was in the first 30 
days. Kudos to their customer service! Anyway, I received the replacement phone and so far 
the screen has not cracked. However, the 4GB MicroSD card keeps messing up. Sometimes when 
I slide the phone open to use the QWERTY keyboard it thinks that I've removed 
the memory card. It must be the jolt from the sliding action that is causing 
it to do this. I have to remove the MicroSD card and put it back 
in for it to read it. It is very annoying.The Good:As for he memory card 
problem; I formatted the card and since then it has only malfunctioned once. The OS 
for this phone is incredible. It's very intuitive and efficient. The phone itself is beautiful 
in its appearance. The QWERTY is the most comfortable to use phone-keyboard I have ever 
used. It is an incredible phone and even despite the bugs it has still been 
worth the money. Nokia really is the best. It may not be as beginner-friendly as, 
say, the iPhone but compared to the E75, most other phones (e.g. iPhone & Blackberry) 
seem so limited.I would recommend the E75 to anyone who wants a phone that can 
do almost everything that a $800 phone can, but doesn't want to spend a fortune.
