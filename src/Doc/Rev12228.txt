I cancelled my at&t account and went to straight talk. I am heavy phone user 
and have had galaxy note phones for years but being I got to buy 2 
and the cash price is way to much. I picked up 2 of these. And 
they are great for the money. Run all of my games no lag. I got 
the better model with 4 gig ram. I multitask and will not have less than 
4gig ram again. And if break it is cheap enough to just buy a new 
phone.
