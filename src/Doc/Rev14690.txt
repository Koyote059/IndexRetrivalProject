Hi all! I've been used this Energy X Plus for more than a week now. 
Like many other commenters stated this phone came with stock android with minimal "bloat ware" 
(which i really like) . Quality built very good and solid, camera not that impressive 
it's just average. Phone pretty responsive once you touch. Battery that BLU claim to be 
3 days but for me an average user checking mail, surf the web it last 
me nearly 2 days (way better than my samsung note from T-Mobile.I had little problem 
with 64gb sd card that it can't read. Turn out to be right out the 
box the sd card was format with xfat file system, so i have to reformat 
it to FAT32 than the phone was able to read the card afterward.I just wish 
BLU woud step up on the hardware little bit more like bump-up the ram to 
2gb or so. Over all this is worth it phone for budget sensitve user like 
myself.I would recommend for anyone that don't have alot of money for the high end 
phone, after all this phone does everything that high end phone does for the budget.
