Excellent phone. I expected horrible battery life due to this phone being so thin but 
it's actually not bad at all.I use a 3 amp micro USB charger and it 
charges from 10% to 80+% in about an hour.I know this will shorten the battery 
life over time but so far it works great.Overnight I use a standard 1 amp 
charger.The performance on the phone is also amazing. No stuttering when moving from screen to 
screen and the ability to keep multiple apps open in the background works great.Can't wait 
for it to get Android 6.0 as per BLU's promise, this phone is going to 
get Android 6.0 but it's a matter of when.Only "con" i have for it, is 
the small storage. 16GB (about 11 usable out of the box) but I knew that 
when I ordered the phone so I can't complain thus I am not taking any 
stars off. Could had used a microSD card slot but I guess since the phone 
is so thin then there was no room for it.
