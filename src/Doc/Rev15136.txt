So far it's a decent phone. I've owned similar Nokia phones for several years now 
and they have always been very reliable. For ~$26, I don't want to be overly 
critical but I do wish the call quality were better. I read a lot of 
rave reviews prior to purchasing and almost all of the reviews mentioned great call quality 
but that has not been my experience. My previous phone was a Nokia Xpress Music 
(old school!) and the call quality on that phone was always good so I don't 
think it's me.It came with a headphone set. My ears tend to be on the 
larger size and I still found the ear buds to be too large.Pros:Inexpensive!Decent battery life 
(several days even after making multiple calls)You won't ever be caught ignoring your kids staring 
at a smart phone all day!Cons:Fair to mediocre call qualityNo Bluetooth capabilityEar buds are largeIf 
you have never owned a Nokia, be sure to read the instruction manual. I was 
used to having buttons on the side of the phone to adjust the volume. It 
took me a while to figure out the volume is adjusted only while in-call by 
using the left and right joystick button.
