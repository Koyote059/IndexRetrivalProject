After a year my teen is fully enjoying the Studio 5 C, & I needed 
a replacement phone so we ordered this thinking it would be an upgrade. Software, ease 
of setup & organizing music, apps etc. is great like any BLU product. Although, I'm 
disappointed in the camera, the photos are not as clear as the 5C and unfortunately 
we're most having problems with the screen (my teen thinks it's singular to our device) 
being either not responsive enough or too responsive (there's no 'tap' it's press firmly), jumping 
forward even without 'auto correct' active. After a week of texting with this phone I 
lost patience. Tech-friend thinks maybe it's the software lagging to keep up with our fingers? 
Will be returning this unfortunately and trying to match the 5C or upgrade to 7.0. 
We gave it a good shot, & will continue to purchase BLU for their excellent 
quality for an unbeatable price!
