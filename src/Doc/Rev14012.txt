I just got my phone. First thing happened was rebooting, never had I seen that 
with new phone. Anyway, after added a few contacts in the phone I saw that 
there were a few more weird contact names. I hoestly don't think this is a 
new phone. It does look new and everything but the inside..... I hope you can 
clarify the issue with me. Another thing is the battery is very warm, is this 
normal? I used samsung, iphone, sony... never seen these things before. Again I just opened 
the box 25 minutes ago, this is brand new order, supposely brand new phone.
