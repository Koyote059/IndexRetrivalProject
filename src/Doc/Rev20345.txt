This is replacing my Galaxy S4 and lives up to the hype. No problems transferring 
phones with Consumer Cellular, I merely took the sim card from my S4 and put 
it into the S7 and I was ready to go, no hassle. Battery life seems 
to be much better than the S4 plus I like the fingerprint log in although 
sometimes it won't recognize it making it frustrating. I end up having to use the 
draw pattern. Overall a nice phone.
