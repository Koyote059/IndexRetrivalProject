I got this phone due to the compact form factor and that it keeps as 
many "flagship" specs as possible. Battery life is not noticeable short or long and that's 
good enough for me. I do Clash Royale and Clash of Clans for a few 
hours each day on it and long stretches can make the phone hot, but not 
too hot to hold. Many times I'll game for 45+ mins at a time and 
the heat is not that bad. Camera is great! Fast autofocus and great quality for 
a smartphone. Placement of the physical shutter button is great if you're taking selfies...not that 
I do.Answer to the million dollar question... Yes, I would buy it again.
