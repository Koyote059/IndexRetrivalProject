I bought this phone hoping it was unlocked because I rather like my boost service, 
and long behold it wasn't unlocked this phone only works with either T-Mobile or Verizon 
nothing else. But I did end up changing my plan to T-Mobile I'm paying the 
same amount with not that great of service but I guess boost doesn't work with 
the 7 plus yet so ill have to wait. but my phone was not opened 
or anything like that. other then the service s*** I'm very pleased with my phone
