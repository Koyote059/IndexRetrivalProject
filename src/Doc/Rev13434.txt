DO NOT BUY!!! the phone I bought is a complete fake. we contacted amazon and 
they assured us it was real but when we contacted Samsung and they checked the 
numbers and everything the told us it was a fake. not only is it fake 
but its also made in Europe. instead of showing LTE it shows me H or 
3g and g. I asked t-moble what that meant and they said since the phone 
was meant for Europe it wasn't going to be working as fast or well on 
American internet. and as time passes I see what they mean. I pay extra money 
for fast unlimited connection and no matter where I am its always super slow and 
not working properly. I should also add that the phone doesn't receive any updates. my 
friend who has the same phone has gotten many updates from Samsung making upgrades to 
speed and applications and all but I haven't had an update since I bought it. 
now one and a half year later from when I bought my phone my battery 
dies twice as fast as it charges. I hope people read this before buying this 
guys crappy and fake phone.
