Great phone, great price. I shopped around for a budget-priced phone with up to date 
specs. I spent days on this, and decided on this phone because it was $100 
less than I was willing to spend but it still had everything I needed. My 
only concern at purchase was I thought battery life would be an issue coming off 
a phone with a 5000 MaH battery I had with the BLU Studio Energy 2. 
What I do is go into settings and turn on battery saver immediately after taking 
the phone off the charger. That way I get about 18 hours of fairly active 
use, calling, texting, streaming video, listening to audio. Then I put on charger and am 
ready for the next day. It has a 2950 MaH battery but lasts more like 
a 4000 MaH one on battery saver mode. Phone is super fast with octa-core processor, 
even running on battery saver - I can't really tell the difference in performance, but 
it's limiting the background processes that drain the juice out of most phones. Phone ships 
with Android 5.1, but it quickly upgrades to the newer Android Marshmallow 6.0 software upon 
initial bootup. Also, phone has an 8MP selfie camera, 5MP is standard on many phones 
which is ice. The front camera is decent at 13MP, on par with a Samsung 
S6. Nice display and beautiful video. At 5.5" it's the right size and the build 
quality is impressive. Good sound from the JBL twin speakers, you can actually hear. Call 
quality seems to be good (I'm on Cricket), and the speakerphone comes in loud and 
clear. It even comes with NFC built-in if that's important to you. Overall, it's a 
5-star phone at a 3-star price point and it has my highest recommendation.
