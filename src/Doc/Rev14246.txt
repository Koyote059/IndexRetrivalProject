I own another S4 and have never had a problem with it. This one worked 
for about a month before developing problems where it would say it could not read 
the SIM card and would restart, sometimes several times a day. We looked online and 
found this is not an uncommon issue that is hardware related. Returned the phone for 
a refund and bought an S5.
