Upgraded to this after completely annihilating my s4 mini (it served its purpose well over 
the years). I didn't really see the need to get one of the latest Galaxy 
cell phones so i got the S5 as the specs are just as good as 
the latest phones (and let's face it guys, specs on these phones are overkill for 
most apps). Only thing I really have a problem with is the bigger size of 
the phone, as my hands are used to smaller phones. I see they have a 
setting to make one handed control a bit easier so I will check that out 
if I need to. But other than that it's a really great phone very fast, 
snappy and responsive.
