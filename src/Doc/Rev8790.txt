Phone showed up on schedule, and even had a battery! So I was happy about 
that!Could NOT activate initially as the tracker ball would NOT scroll. Had to replace the 
tracker ball from my old phone! Then it "worked". Verizon told me it was NOT 
a Verizon ID # LOL. Finally got it activated. Took long time to get email 
as it kept trying to populate Blackberry email. WTF? Transferred media with my SIM card, 
but NO Contacts transferred yet using my original Vodaphone card and SIM cards. What a 
mess... waiting for other shoe to drop. Very disappointed over all.
