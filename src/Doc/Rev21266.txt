I love this phone. Tmobile store clerk helped me get signal and I was good 
to go. Plenty of ringtone options. I dont really use the apps that come with 
it. I don't download things, so I don't know about that. I know I like 
the style of the phone. Love the free white clear back cover they sent with 
phone. chinese version of the real things, so you know that it will have somethings 
that are not as good as the real thing-like enough memory, or storage space, etc....
