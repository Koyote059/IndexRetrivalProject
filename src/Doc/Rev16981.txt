Well to start off, this product does not appear to be just used, it appears 
the screen has been replaced and bad screen quality. Turned it on and open the 
camera and first thing to happen is the lock screen image vaguely froze in the 
background of all my other apps I checked. Then i opened a keyboard and then 
the keyboard froze in the background. I am very upset with this as it was 
said to just be used and not refurbished and no problems were noted. Compared the 
outside of the phone to my mom's iphone 5s and it was not the same 
home button or outside design. Same phone.
