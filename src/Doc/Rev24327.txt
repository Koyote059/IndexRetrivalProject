I've had this phone for 2 months and I love the stock Android on it. 
It's very simple and the Operating system is exactly the same as other Android devices. 
The camera is excellent. I did however download a different camera app because I didn't 
like the one that was already on there. Some cons are: after using the phone 
for a while, the back will get very hot and it will start to be 
sluggish/slower. Another thing is that when I turn the phone on, I always have to 
select Google keyboard in the settings.(Google voice typing is automatically selected) but maybe that's my 
fault. I also had a Moto G 1st generation which I liked better but this 
is somewhat comparable to that.Update: I've had this phone for a little over 6 months 
now. It has become VERY laggy and slow. Apps are always force closing and freezing. 
Snapchat has become unusable on this phone because of the lag. The past 2 days, 
I've had to take the battery out twice to reset the phone because it froze. 
I wouldn't recommend this phone anymore.
