This phone has slightly weaker reception quality than my old phone but it is a 
lot faster processing wise. I tested the phone by calling it with Google Voice and 
it didn't start ringing till the second ring on Google voice. The auto-focus is okay 
for the price. I suggest using this phone on wi-fi when possible to help with 
the weaker reception. Edit: This phone started locking up and going unresponsive after a few 
months. I can barely use it now. I do not recommend this phone. I know 
it is cheap, but unresponsive is bad.
