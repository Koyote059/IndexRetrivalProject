I like this phone, I was skeptical because of reviews saying it couldn't be connected 
to Straight talk, but I live in California and had no trouble at all, got 
my same number and everything. I just had to pay $6.99 to get the network 
access code and that was it! I do see the battery goes kinda fast and 
sometimes the phone doesn't seem to like the charger(sometimes its goes on and off charge, 
but it does charge), but other than that it's great!
