Absolutely love my new PRIV! My former phone was a Motorola Droid 4 which has 
a full sliding keyboard however it lacks power and storage. I use my phone for 
business and I have long nails so a physical keyboard is a must.PROS: dual facing 
camera, large screen, full slider QWERTY keyboard, unlockedCONS: a pit priceyOf course BlackBerry still has 
only a four-line QWERTY keyboard which means you must use ALT to get numbers and 
they are located on the left instead of the top.There is no up, down or 
side to side keys to scroll the screen while typingThe period and comma are located 
in ALT M and NPerhaps one day the designers will consult with those of us 
who actually use a BlackBerry!Blond Prepper
