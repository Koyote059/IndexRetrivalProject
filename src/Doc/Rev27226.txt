When they say no warranty I should have KNOWN BETTER. I am a victim of 
this disgusting product. I got the item in 10 days, seems like from China. I 
charged it and inserted my AT&T sim, turned on. The screen lighted up for a 
few seconds and went blank. Tried to turn off and on several times, the key 
pad lighs up but not the screen. DON'T BUY IT. BUY ONE WITH WARRANTY.
