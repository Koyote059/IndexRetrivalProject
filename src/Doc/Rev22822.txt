Got this for my 14-year-old daughter after being very happy with other Nokias I've owned 
including my E71 that I still use. She was mainly interested in the pink color 
- little else mattered to her. I will say the pictures don't do it justice 
- it is a very attractive phone. Like all Nokia's I've used, it is well 
built, has excellent voice quality and it has a long battery life. She can text 
on it as well as any other phone she has had, and the wi-fi is 
a really great feature for this price-range phone. I thought I wanted 3G capability, but 
frankly in practial day-to-day use not having it has not been a negative in any 
way.
