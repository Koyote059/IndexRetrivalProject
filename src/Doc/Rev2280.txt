Great phone. Its fast and responsive. I'm using it on T-mobile with no problems and 
Wi-Fi calling works.Pros: Fast Lots of LTE bands supported T-mobile wifi calling (not sure if 
it supports others) High resolution screen Takes decent picutres, not top of the line but 
good enough for causal useCons: The ambient light senor is glitchy and I find I 
have to manually ajust it a lot. It'll sometimes think low light is now light 
and the screen can get very, very dark (almost no backlight) No external storage Not 
a big fan of the ZTE Apps but I was able to disable all but 
the "Rock my Run"Overall a very good phone for the price and would definitely recommend 
to others
