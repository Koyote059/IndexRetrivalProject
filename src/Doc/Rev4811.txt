Just got the phone yesterday and set it up and I have been playing around 
with it today. I have nothing bad to say about this phone so far. In 
fact I am blown away by it so far. Big beautiful screen, fast responsive, removable 
battery and storage, Lime green case looks really cool, it comes with a case, screen 
protector, head phones and charger (was not expecting all that from a "budget phone", and 
the list goes on. I had the note 3 before and so far I like 
this phone just as much if not more. I know the note has more ram 
and a better processor but I really can't tell a difference. The 4G is plenty 
fast and I even get signal in a building at work that I could not 
get with most phone I have gone through.
