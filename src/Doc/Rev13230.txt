phone out of box that is supposed to be new, it had a display problem 
when first turned on that won't go away. tried to find out why but there 
is a permanant line in the middle of the display that impeds the view. with 
no warranty on this phone there is no way to return and get a new 
one. would not reccomend this seller for a cell phone, because their products come with 
problems and you are stuck with no recourse
