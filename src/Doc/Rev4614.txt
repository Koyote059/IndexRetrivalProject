My husband hated my old Blackberry Storm and wanted to go back to a flip 
phone. He loves this phone. He's not much of a techie. I have a Droid 
and can't wait to upgrade to Droid 4G--but want to wait for them to come 
out with a slider key board. So if you want to just use your phone 
to call people (he doesn't even take pics with it!) this is a great phone 
for you.
