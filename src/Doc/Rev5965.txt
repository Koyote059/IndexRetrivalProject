Phone4My I-phone4 arrived as promised. The package said: Can not be returned when opened. Based 
on my experience with many Apple products during the last 20+ years, I opened it.After 
installing the SIM card it showed a high signal atthe T-Mobil store.At home the signal 
was 4dots at turn on. After dialing a number, the signal dropped to one dot,after 
a few seconds to surging, and finally to no signal. This process is very repeatable. 
The Apple store recommended a new SIM card. Same result:worked in the store, not outside. 
Back to the Apple store. They reinstalledand up grated the whole program. NO CHANGE!!!According to 
the local Apple store, the phone was first sold in 2011. Not exactly a new 
phone.I now know where not to buy cell phones.How do I know what's in the 
box. The Apple store will turn it on for me andreplace it right there, if 
it doesn't work.I just kissed $245.50 good by.All your other products were great and I 
will continue to be your customer.Peter Simeth
