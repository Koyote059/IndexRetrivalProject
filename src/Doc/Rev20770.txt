This is the best phone out from Nokia as of today. Solid design, overall metal 
casing, good design and craftsmanship. The first ever smartphone or PDA that is not bulky. 
Buttons are easy to press even I have huge meaty fingerstip-type. camera is ok. OS 
is good which I wish its a windows mobile. The best of all is the 
free "Advance call manager" which works wonders against harassing dumb callers ;)
