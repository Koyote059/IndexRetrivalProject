Used to be a great phone years ago. I bought this for my mom as 
a transition closer to a smart phone. The phone had issues receiving texts and would 
often shut down when you tried to open a text. The charging cable also didn't 
seem to fit quite right. I thought maybe this www a faulty phone so I 
had Amazon send me another new one to try and it did the same exact 
thing! I'm guessing that despite it being a new device, the software and basic parts 
of the phone are still technically old as I don't believe they are manufactured anymore. 
I would not recommend this phone anymore.
