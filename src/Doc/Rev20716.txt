Having used a 1st gen Moto G, and a 2nd gen Moto X, I was 
expecting similar build qualities. I don't know if it just went down hill once Lenovo 
acquired Motorola from Google or if I just happened to get two phones from the 
same bad batch. When the first phone started exhibiting "ghost touch" a day into using 
the phone, I contacted Motorola customer support. I asked if there was a firmware or 
software update to fix the issue. I was told by the agent that the behavior 
was not typical and to return for replacement. I find no fault with Amazon's replacement 
policy because they had a new unit sent to me the next day. The new 
phone started doing the same thing!!! A quick Google search brought up results of others 
having the same issue with no fix available. The standard answer on Lenovo's support forums 
is to take the phone to a local repair center.When the phone worked, it was 
great. Apps were responsive, the fingerprint reader was speedy, and the display was sharp. I 
really liked using it. However, when the phone started acting up, it would switch screens 
on its own, open apps on its own, and type on its own. It even 
called my sister by itself, and I had to explain the wonkiness that just happened. 
One phone I can justify trying again, but twice in a row, it needs to 
go back for a refund.
