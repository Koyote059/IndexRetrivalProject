Just got my classic today and it's great. I had the Q10 and liked it 
but thought the screen was just too small. Then I got the Passport and that 
was very good, I liked everything about it except it was just about a half 
inch too wide. Now I have the Classic and it's perfect. I was a little 
conserned about the processor and RAM, but every thing works fine. And battery is good 
so no need for faster processor. I love the track pad, it's much easier to 
cut and paste than every phone I've had (including Andriod). I have been waiting a 
long time for this phone.Is it heavy, well in relation to most phones yes, but 
it's not like it's 5lbs. Feels good in the hand and if it's too heavy 
for you, you need to start exercising.If you love having a keyboard, you will love 
this phone.
