When this phone arrived, its battery would not charge. However, VODOZO was very helpful in 
replacing it.Once it arrived, I was pleased with the phone itself and the accessories that 
come with it. It's a very good Android device; I've installed a ton of apps 
and games and I've had no problems at all running everything I want.I did have 
a slight issue using the cell data. Make sure you edit your network settings to 
setup an Access Point Network (APN) for your carrier! Once I got it set up, 
it works great.My two complains are that it randomly disconnects from WiFi, and one of 
the decals of the company's name fell off the phone within hours.I would definitely recommend 
this phone, and I'd consider it comparable to other phones 5x the price.
