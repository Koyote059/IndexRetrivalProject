Had a bad experience with the phone and I wouldn't recommend it... the charge port 
stopped working after 2 months. when I brought it, it said 1 year USA warranty. 
I have been trying for 3 weeks to find out how to send it back 
and all I keep getting is its to late to return... so I'm out of 
90 dollars after 45 days of usage. if it wasn't for this I would rate 
it a 3. but when you pay your hard earned money for a product you 
expect it to work. I guess sometimes you have to get brand named products for 
a higher fee or deal with things like this
