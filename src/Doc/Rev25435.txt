I bought this to replace my iPhone 6 that got stolen a few weeks ago. 
I couldn't afford to purchase another 6 so I decided the 5S would suffice. I 
received the phone today and so far, I am very happy with my purchase. It 
looks like it has never been used and it works perfectly. It arrived much earlier 
than expected as well so that is a plus!
