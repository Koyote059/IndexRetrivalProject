Smart phones are confusing. Everyone is telling you why theirs is better. so the question 
is how do you use your phone? Email? this one's got it- surfing and face 
book ... yes. calls and texts.. yes. every google app you can think of... yes 
i cant believe you can get this kind of value for 50 dollars. easily 400 
dollars from major carriers, this is the second one i have bought. ( my younger 
son wanted one too) I might get one myself when my phone dies.Highly recommended
