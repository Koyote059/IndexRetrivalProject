I bought one phone and it was good. So that, I ordered another one for 
my wife. The second one was very bad. It did not come in a original 
box. The charger was not for that phone and looks very cheap and low quality. 
The USB cable to connect to computer was missing. The sim door key was missing 
either. So that I have just returned it today. Can not understand why they could 
sell that product. I really hate to return things as I waste my time for 
searching, ordering, returning, and shopping again.Amazon must select providers more carefully!
