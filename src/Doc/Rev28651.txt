The phone came with one page of copied usage instructions. No manual.The phone I received 
was a LOCKED cell phone. I took it to two different AT&T locations to try 
to get my SIM card to work, but they could not do it. Both said 
the phone was locked.It is an incorrectly labeled product and completely useless.
