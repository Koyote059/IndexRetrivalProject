So I purchased this one from Perfect Trading Inc, and it arrived in a seal 
pack condition. Though I had to waste half an hour to set up as it 
came in with all defaults set and that too in some Chinese language. Therefore I 
had to find my way through language settings and then restored it. Doing that allowed 
me to get to all the initial settings as it should prompt for when you 
turn it on for the first time. Along with this the charger that came with 
it was European plug. The nice thing about this was it came pre-installed with screen 
protector. Plus it also had Sony ear-phones in the box. Also to all who are 
curious; Yes it does HEAT a lot and drains battery heavily. In order to take 
care of the heating issue, Sony has disabled 2 cores of CPU in the OTA 
update, hence making it very similar to SnapDragon 805 and 801. But the heating issue 
is still there after the update as well.
