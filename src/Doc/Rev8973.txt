This phone is great for the price. Software is not up to par as Android 
and iPhone but still gets the job done. For the price this unlocked phone is 
great. Free navigation works very well, download individual states for US maps or download the 
whole country's maps. Web browser works okay but could have better features. The internal memory 
sometimes runs slow and kills heavy programs like 3rd party web browser software when dowloading 
large web pages.Have had the phone for over a month now and had no issues 
with it. Can't install the latest apps/games but for the price I'm able to live 
without them.
