The phone looked new. It had no scratches on it. However, there is a problem 
with the battery. It dies extremely fast and the phone dies at 20 percent. I 
contacted the seller and exchanged with another phone, but it has the same problem as 
the old one. I have to always make sure I have my charger with me 
because it doesn't stay on for a long time and dies even when the phone 
says it's 20% or 34% charged. Such an inconvenience.
