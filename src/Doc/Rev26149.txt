This is a nice phone with typical Nokia layout. It has always been easy for 
me to jump from one Nokia to the next due to the continuity of their 
layout. The camera and such are great. My only complaint is that it feels more 
flimsy and creaks when I push the lower buttons. My other Nokia bar phones have 
definitely been more robust.
