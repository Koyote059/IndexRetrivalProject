Five people tried to activate this phone for me and could not. I took it 
to a Verizon store and two people there could not do it, even after several 
calls by them to their superiors in other areas. After over an hour at the 
Verizon store, I was told the phone I had just bought was too old and 
could no longer be activated. There was absolutely nothing they could do for me! So 
now I am stuck with a phone that I just gave over eighty dollars for 
and I can not use it! I don't understand how you can sell an item, 
back this product, all the time knowing it will not possibly work. I am just 
sick over this whole mess! And No I would not recommend this phone, since they 
do not work anymore!
