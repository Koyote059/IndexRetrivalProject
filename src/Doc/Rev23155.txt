I was very nervous about buying a phone without a contract, but it has worked 
wonderfully. The 920 uses mini-SIM card like my other Nokia phone, so switching them out 
was easy. I've had no drop or interruption of my service in USA and when 
traveling goutside of USA.Word of caution: Since I purchased an unlocked phone, I wasn't prepared 
to receive a phone that was setup with Portuguese settings, user guide, and electrical plug-ins. 
But I used the YAHOO Translator to convert Protugues to English and interpret how to 
get thru the first screens so that I could reset the phone to English and 
then proceed with setups. It took about an hour to overcome this drawback, but the 
phone is so totally worth the extra hiccup.My contacts/messages/calendar all transfered easily via the bluetooth 
syncing option and i have been able to download user guide from the internet and 
used the Nokia Discussion forum when I have very specific questions about phone features and 
settings (great resource of info!). The pictures I loaded from my old phone to new 
phone via ZUNE Windows phone app, very easily. This Windows phone is great, and I'm 
so glad that i left iPhone last year! The Nokia phone is more of a 
useful tool rather than just game playing device like iPhone was. I really like the 
Notes and Office for my work needs, and the driving/maps all is awesome when i 
am traveling to unfamiliar place or to other countries (download country/region to your phone for 
free). However, the Windows platform needs to catch-up some on the features and applications, but 
I still find everything that I want and need in the Windows OS and Apps 
Store. THE CAMERA ON THIS PHONE IS AWESOME! Great pics, video, and edit/fun apps to 
go with the camera.If you are not addicted to iPhone, you will really like this 
phone. But if you are an iPhone diehard, you probably won't like it.
