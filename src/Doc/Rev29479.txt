MobilePC sent me a product with a defective camera which would turn black without an 
explanation and I'd have to reboot the phone. The screen had been replaced with a 
new one but it was badly put together and looked cheap. All of this I 
was told by the repair center that I had to attend just three months after 
I purchased this phone, listed as Used, but Good. Plenty of times the phone shut 
off by itself, making me believe the battery was broken but after getting it checked, 
it was the motherboard that eventually stopped working. It says no warranty but there was 
no mention the phone was this beat down!
