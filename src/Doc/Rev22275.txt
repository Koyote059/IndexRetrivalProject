I LOVE THS PHONE...I got it because i had a Samsung galaxy S6 with 32G 
and no removable battery....and I hate that...so I swich to LG....and got the awesome LG 
V10....I'm very impressed. And that's coming from a guy that is a Samsung lover....I had 
a an S3, S4, S5, S6....and I waited for the S7...and it finally came out 
and we'll it let me very desapointed..not much different that my s6....so that's why I 
have a V10..love the 5.7 inch screen...great resolution....and something that I love in the Samsung 
and don't have it any more....it's the removable battery and the option of adding more 
memory....I ran out of memory on my s6...and we'll had to let go of Samsung 
for good...now LG will be my number one phone for me...the LG v10 is a 
big phone not for everyone....for someone with big had like me will enjoy this phone 
a lot...
