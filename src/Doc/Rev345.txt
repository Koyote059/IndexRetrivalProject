Wanted a spare phone in case something happens to my main.It's really thin. As thin 
as the iPhone 6S Plus. Almost exact dimensions too. Pretty nifty that it comes with 
all the 'necessities' out of the box like a phone case and screen protector. Setup 
was pretty straight forward. Almost no bloat ware which is always a good thing.Battery life 
is long lasting. 2 days. Very minimal use. Only down by 30%.Screen is nice but 
I've seen better. But not bad.Camera sucks. Picture is not as good as the iPhone.Overall. 
For the price. You can't really ask for much. Dual sim, 32gb storage and sd 
card. No bells and whistle like wireless charging or nfc but it's a spare (for 
me) so no biggy
