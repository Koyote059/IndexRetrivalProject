2nd Update today is 6/14 and I HAVE NOT HEARD from them several other reviews 
also mentioned poor customer service/relations so IF you don't care to have anyone backing the 
product buy one. I have purchased another brand for my husband and have a very 
very bad view of NOT VERYKOOL! My other comments about the phone itself still standIt 
was, not hard to set up, seems to hold the charge, had no problem with 
the sim. only had it a few days so will update the review as time 
goes on I am not a phone nerd or attached at the hip to my 
cell phone. I use a prepaid phone and primarily use it when traveling or out 
of the house as a "emergency" phone friends kept nagging me that they wanted me 
to text or send pics so enter Verykool. so far it IS just that and 
I have sent texts and photos. BTW the camera seems excellent and I WILL probably 
be using the phone more because of it.UPDATE I received it on 6/3 I had 
enjoyed it so my hubby said get me one Went to the listing and the 
price had changed from $79.99 to $62.46 that is a sizeable reduction SO I attempted 
to contact verykool no where to find them on Amazon SO I went to their 
web site and sent a letter on Sun 6/5 regarding the change in price and 
could I get a adjustment or did I have to jump through hoops and return 
to to buy it cheaper. As of today 3 business days later nary a word 
from VERYKOOL for shame!!SAD TO SAY GREAT ITEM BAD COMPANY
