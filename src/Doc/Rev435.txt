I recently ordered a Blackberry Gemini 8520 unlocked gsm phone for use internationally. When I 
recieved said order, it in fact was not a Gemini 8520, but a Blackberry Curve; 
of which I think may have been re-furbished. I didn't want the hassle of returning 
the Curve because I need to use a phone immediately. So I did not complain 
until I was asked to write a review of this item.Thanks!
