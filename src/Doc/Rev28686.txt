This is a nice inexpensive smartish watch. I have an iPhone 6s Plus and after 
some trial and error I finally got it paired with my phone. The display is 
nice and it has multiple analog faces to choose from. Because it is round you 
cannot read all of the information that appears at the top of the screen. The 
pedometer did not match my phone's pedometer which I kept in my pocket all day. 
The sound quality is good but not loud, unless it is ringing and you cannot 
turn that down. Also all of my apps now play sound solely through the watch 
which I don't like. I did like how I got text notifications even if I 
couldn't reply to them. My problem with Siri is it only wants to call my 
phone. So over all not bad for the price I guess but I am sending 
it back for those glitches mentioned above.
