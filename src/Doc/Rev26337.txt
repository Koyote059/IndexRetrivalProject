Smaller than S-II that it replaced but much better product. Screen amazing, performance too, and 
with LTE I'm future proofed. Only problem so far is Samsung WatchOn (IR blaster for 
TV) I have homes in USA and UK but application can't cope with that - 
I have to delete USA room to set up UK and vice versa
