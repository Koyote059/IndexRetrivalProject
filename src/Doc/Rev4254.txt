The LG G3 32gb version is a great phone. I only have a couple issues. 
The lg skin especially with lollipop has improved greatly but could still use some fine 
tuning. Additionally the phone has overheating issues when the screen brightness is above 75%. Beyond 
that the phone has great cameras. Having lollipop is a great addition. The 3gb of 
ram is more than enough for daily tasks. Knock code and knock on are great 
and I use them on a daily basis. If your in the market for a 
powerful phone at a lower price. The lg g3 should definitely be considered.
