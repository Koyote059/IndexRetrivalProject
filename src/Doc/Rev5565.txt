Just got my Galaxy s5 in the mail today and so far it is working 
like my previous s5. My only problem!!: it did not come with the authentic galaxy 
s5 charger!! Thats a scam. I expected the original charger which is needed to charge 
the phone. I don't think the phone would be designed as it were if it 
the correct charger was not to be used. If the seller doesn't want to replace 
my charger or give me the correct one entirely, I'll be forced to go out 
and purchase a s5 charger. Somewhat disappointed.
