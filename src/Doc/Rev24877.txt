Very good phone in aspect to the price, I bought the phone for the SIM 
from original country (I'm currently in US ) carrier, but the thing that I didn't 
figure out until I received is it doesn't support any languages other than the ones 
coming with system even in SMS messages which is pretty logical if you would ask! 
so, yeah that's as my only issue with this phone and as I told I'm 
using it just to receive any important messages/calls from my non-US number
