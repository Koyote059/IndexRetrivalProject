phone promises lot gives lessmost importantly 48mp option camera modesi didnt find much difference normal 
mode 48mp mode sometimes photos taken 48mp noisy 48mp mode doesnt work well strong ambient 
light presentother issue google assistant tried many times wake assistant command ok google doesnt work 
ive set everything assistant essential use voice assistance useplease dont feel heart broken far two 
drawbacks found must say battery wow one full charge phone last almost 2 days normal 
use surprised camera also works well 13k mobile except 48mp mode maybe due software issues 
otherwise phones runs quite smoothly load games apps quickly
