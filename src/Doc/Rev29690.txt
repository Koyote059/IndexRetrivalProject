Finally received it yesterday after the awful shipping company Lasership delivered it to the wrong 
address. I spent hours on the phone with them to get them to pick it 
up and bring it to me. They had no idea till I called them 3 
times.Phone did not work too well.. As a heads up to new owners, I found 
it unusual for the phone to come with battery installed. Took me a while to 
figure out why it wouldn't boot up...ffinally found amost invisible tiny tape covering the contacts 
on battery. Of course, any literature enclosed was all in Chinese and found nothing about 
this on web sites.All the available themes are also in Chinese. Phone is loaded with 
bloat. No matter where you go, more bloat appears along with more screens offering downloads 
for even more.More annoying was some intermittent condition causing a few different problems that I 
couldn't source.Back to the drawing board.I could have probably lived with some of this, but 
the battery life was not acceptable. Short fuse, even with all the fancy "battery saver" 
apps.
