I got this ~January 2015 and it's held up well. It came with a faulty 
battery that, after 6 months, inflated and would run dry within 2 hours. It was 
under warranty, so Posh sent me a new one for free. This second one is 
a bit aged, but still does fine. I use my phone pretty lightly, and it 
easily lasts 24 hours if I try to save power. It feels slow now, but 
it's also been two years. I've dropped it 20+ times, sometimes without a case, and 
it physically only has a few small dents or chipped paint. A square mm of 
pixels is permanently brighter but otherwise still works. I'm looking for a new phone now 
because the very bottom of the touch screen no longer responds, and this is probably 
due to dropping it over and over.The gist I'm trying to get at is that 
this is good for the price. Don't expect an amazing phone for 2016. But if 
all you're doing is texting, browsing, watching youtube, and taking a few pics, this will 
do you just fine.
