If I could give it 0 stars I would. Received iPhone 5c heavily scratched and 
the corners dented not s big deal it said it would have scratches etc.. But 
the screen must have been replaced and not well at all it sat very uneven. 
I hadn't activated and realized that you could only hear a call if you had 
it in speaker phone. So really this was inspected for defected REALLY? Warning never but 
from this company!!!
