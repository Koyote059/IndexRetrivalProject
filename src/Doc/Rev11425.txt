I purchased this phone in January 2013, and after a year and 2 months, I 
am already looking into changing it.It performs great as far as what apps and such 
goes, but the unbelievable decline in battery life is very disappointing. The battery life has 
gone from a standard 6-8h use time, to a lucky 3-5h use time, and an 
awful 8h standby time. This wouldn't be as big a problem if the battery was 
replaceable, but as Sony decided to make this phone a unibody, this becomes impossible.Overall, great 
phone, horrible batteryl.
