I can't fairly review as it only worked for me about 10 days. No sooner 
than I got halfway used to using it I rolled over on it with a 
socket in my pocket. Broke the screen and now it only shows a bunch of 
lines. Can't say anything bad since that was my fault. However, I have done lots 
of stuff without breaking the old phone I kept in the same pocket, but it 
had a smaller screen. I got used to doing without some of the features of 
my old phone but loved the camera, which took great pictures.
