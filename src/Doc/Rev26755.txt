Great device itself I was finally able to start using it yesterday my sim card 
was too big. Few scratches around the device which was not in the description from 
the seller, came with a random bootleg charger, did not come with the key to 
open the sim and SD card compartment, I had to use my earring. It does 
take a lot of getting used to after dealing with android for so long but 
I love the physical keyboard and the size of the device. The fact that phones 
are getting the size they are is a bit crazy. Considering what I paid for 
this phone I expected it to be packed much better than it was, that truly 
pissed me off honestly.
