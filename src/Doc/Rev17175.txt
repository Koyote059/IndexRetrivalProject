It does protect the tablet... so much that I can't get to it. When I 
have my tablet in this casing, I can't turn on and off my tablet. The 
"power" button does not reach the power button on the tablet when it is in 
the casing, so I have to take it out everytime. TOO INCONVENIENT and too cumbersome 
to have to remove the case everytime. I have sent it back.
