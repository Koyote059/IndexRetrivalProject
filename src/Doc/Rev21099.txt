At first there were two problems with the product iPhone 4s unlocked I purchased . 
The WiFi tab was greyed out dim and I can't connect to Internet even I 
have a sim card with high speed internet and Wi Fi at home. There is 
no cellular data network tab on the phone to edit the APN. I called Wireless 
2 go They told me they had never had this issue before and they were 
ready to refund me and sent me a label to return the product. After consideration 
I decided not to return the product. I reset and erased all the the content 
and network and started activating the iPhone again. It was a hard time! Finally the 
Wi Fi tab works and the Internet is connected. However when I browsed Google the 
Wi Fi stopped working and the screen displayed "could not activate cellular dater network" . 
I had to redo everything again. Totally 3 times. Now it is connected to Wi 
Fi and Internet but I don't know how long this status can maintain. I even 
dare not to browse Google website on this iphone. I think the shadow of the 
former carrier is still there even the phone is unlocked. Is there a way to 
find out the cellular data network tab and APN to solve this problem?Anyway I have 
to say that this iPhone 4s has a good look and almost no scratches.
