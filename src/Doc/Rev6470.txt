it says that it is Unlocked in the ad, but is it? I opened up 
the package, turned on the device and it strangely it had a magenta letter T 
on the screen. Hang about, it is a T- Mobile germany phone. with t Mobile 
apps and customisations. and No nokia blue theme. Only t mobile grau (grey). It made 
me laugh considering that i have a strong anti carrier phone policy. that was false 
advertisig on the sellers part.
