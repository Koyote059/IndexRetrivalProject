I would like to share my experience with this transaction. Received the phone promptly, beautiful 
little thing, that my daughter loved to play with. Windows applications for it may not 
be as plentiful as on Android, but they work surprisingly well. No issues.6 months later 
the phone just hung. I have given CPR to Windows phones before, and saved two 
Nokia's that way (using Microsoft recommended recovery tool) but this time , it was not 
to be.I contacted the seller expecting a drawn out process, but was pleasantly surprised to 
receive a prompt response and a fair resolution.Highly recommend the product and the seller!
