This phone was a gift and my first time every using a Smart Phone. I 
am pleased with it as a cell phone. It is basic. It has all the 
bells and whistles of all the other cell phones on the market, but it acts 
like a Tablet and app offerings are limited, which is fine, i am not a 
big user of apps on a phone. I still use a computer. The phone has 
a HUGE assortment of ring tones and notification sounds. It is very sensitive and does 
not remember settings so easy. I had to go back to audio settings numerous times 
to increase the volume. the radio function is great. It amazed me that the phone 
displays the stations call letters and the song playing. It will also let you record 
what you are listening to. On a sad note, the sound is tinny while in 
a call. The same is true for when the call is on speaker. If there 
is a lot of back noise, it is very hard to hear. The text pad 
is tiny, but i was extremely surprised that it recognized my key strokes, It was 
easier to text with the small keypad rather than turn the phone for an expanded 
view. Like I said the phone is light and i fear dropping it. I have 
large fingers. There is no way to adjust the size of the keyboard like many 
other cell phones, and the phone is VERY light. It does not feel like you 
are holding anything in your hand, so handling the phone is an adventure. I am 
trying so hard to not drop it. I would recommend a heavy case that can 
give the phone some weight. Like I said this is starter phone for me. I 
will be looking to purchase a larger, heavier phone. Otherwise, it serves the purpose. In 
conclusion, the phone is decent, If you are just interested in making calls and texting, 
then this is the phone for you. Enjoy!! :-)
