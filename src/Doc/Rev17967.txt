What an wonderful surprise for a low cost phone. My expectation was low because I've 
been buying the low end Samsung phones (Galaxy Y and Young) that are about the 
same price and definitely show it. The Moto E is a giant leap forward and 
even a few $ less.Screen is fantastic. Excellent resolution and perfectly responsive. Gorilla glass is 
nice addition since screen protectors are pesky. Running Kit Kat is a major plus and 
not much bloatware added. Lots of speed in comparison to those low end Samsungs. Streams 
music over 3G data connection without issue and has plenty of storage for apps. Sound 
quality for music and calls is great plus a loud speaker.Extremely happy with this phone 
- it is amazing for the price!
