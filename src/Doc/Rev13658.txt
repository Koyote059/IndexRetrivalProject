Product is as described with the exception of the UK and European adapters, which were 
not included. I noticed others made the same comment so the pictures should be updated 
to reflect the actual contents. Otherwise product is new and performs as advertised. I have 
installed an International SIM card (which is suprisingly expensive for the people calling and texting 
me) and will be using the phome in Germany and the Middle East later this 
month.
