My previous Note 4 was lte capable and I spent over a hundred dollars more 
to get that capability again with this phone. HOWEVER, This phone does NOT operate with 
4g lte. The phone also freezes often when using the built in talk to text 
or when using apps that require internet access. I don't know who I need to 
speak to, but I want the phone I paid for or the difference reimbursed to 
me for paying 100 plus dollars for the upgraded phone that is advertised here and 
is NOT what I received
