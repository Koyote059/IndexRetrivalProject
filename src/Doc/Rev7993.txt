This is a great phone and it works great with straight talk with 4 g 
lte. Older phone but specs are great even when compared to the new phones. I 
hardly ever give 5 stars but this phone is a 41/2 star. Shipping was quick. 
Box seemed generic but had everything needed. If you are looking for a Galaxy S 
3 I would choose this all day. In fact, dollar for dollar I might choose 
this phone over the S 4. Check out the S 4 vs Note 2 videos 
on YT and make your own choice.
