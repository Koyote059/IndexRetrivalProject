This is a well constructed, colourful handset with some excellent technological features, Windows Phone is 
maturing nicely, and the 820 has got a really palatable price point to boot. It's 
been overshadowed by others in the range, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a 
class act. Very good and nice device if you want to upgrade your old phone. 
For me I received all the benefits I was looking for: Attractive design, microSD support, 
Great screen and Powerful camera.
