The phone is real nice. Despite all the reviews in Youtube from different companies. The 
phone works great, its incredible fast and it is the last phone with the freedom 
you need to add extra memory since the new HTC models doesn't have the micro 
SD slot and not removable battery (or back cover).This phone comes already unlocked from the 
provider and you don't have to introduce an unlocking code. It comes on its original 
box (AT&T), it's brand new but the only issue is that phone doesn't come with 
earphones. It's not big issue at all, bur it would be great if HTC could 
include the earphones with microphone.The battery duration might be an issue, so I recommend to 
buy:- Anker External Battery Pack- Hyperion AT&T HTC Vivid 4G 2 x Battery + ChargerFor 
less than $400 USD this is an excellent choice for an android phone.
