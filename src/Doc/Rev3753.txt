Pros: sleek design, very slim, functions fast (navigation is quick and not luggish), two sd 
slots, inexpensive, unlocked, came quickly, easy set up (tho it did take some time getting 
internet configured for cricket services), feels like a good quality but, however there are flaws.Cons: 
Poor screen resolution, lots of pixels in photos and videos, sound with head phones on 
are very low (and have to be put on max volume in order to hear), 
poor sound quality (with phone calls as well). Unsure if you can register this phone 
for warranty, doesn't seem to have 4G capabilitiesI saw this phone in a cricket wireless 
store, though it was all sold out. It seemed like the best option out of 
the budget phones Cricket is selling it for 100 dollars with activation....not without.Anyway, when first 
opening the box I noticed how slim the phone is. I also realized that the 
gold option is very dark/grey like color, so I wish I chose white. It was 
wasy set up. Though the display resolution is very poor (i feel like my free 
phone has better quality). This phone is fast though, and has perks like 2 sim 
card slots, and a fancy processor. I just am not satisfied with the quality of 
the phone, poor sound (music sounds scratchy), poor screen display (very pixilated).
