Everything works except the keyboard. The keyboard RANDOMLY disappears when I'm swiping or doesn't come 
up when I open an app. Memory gets full very easily. You must buy a 
16 - 32 GB SD card when getting this thing. I have bare necessity apps 
and an 8 GB SD card. My card is already full after 3 months. But 
I do have a lot of podcast and pics on my SD card.I've contacted customer 
service about the keyboard issue. No e-mail response, just an automated e-mail.UPDATE: Now I can't 
download any apps, it just says insufficient space even though there's 500 mb available.Will not 
buy from this company again. I wanted a basic phone that functions properly. It's a 
basic phone that works most of the time.
