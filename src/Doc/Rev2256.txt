Firstly, the phone is solid! Unfortunately AT&T does not support this model for 4G or 
LTE, nor do they support secure payment apps for this phone. Although the phone supports 
said features, AT&T will not support them unless the phone is locked to the AT&T 
network and branded. This is extremely disappointing as the international version is over $100 less 
than a branded phone tied to the carrier.
