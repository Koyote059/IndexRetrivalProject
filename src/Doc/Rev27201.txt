Over all a ok phone! if your looking for a phone that will last long. 
Don't buy this phone. After sometime it has trouble charging and calls had to be 
on speaker! the camera struggles when focusing but when its focused right the 13MP Display 
is beautiful! Also the warranty isn't what it is. the device would have to have 
a malfunction within the phone in order to get it replaced!! Lovely.. Time for a 
new phone..
