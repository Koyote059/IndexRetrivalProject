It's actually a pretty good phone for the money.Upsides - Simple, functional, sound quality was 
good on calls. Pretty cool that it takes a 64GB microSD card.Downsides - Difficult to 
root, battery life isn't great (but you'd expect that from a smaller battery), the microUSB 
port got loose after a few months making it difficult to charge.
