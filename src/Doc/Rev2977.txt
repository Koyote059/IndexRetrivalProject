I've only had this cell phone for a few months now,and it has already stopped 
working.The battery life was very very short on it,which annoyed me since I'm usually out 
and about all day.The camera was crap. The 2.5 millimeter headphone jack is worthless,I don't 
have any headphones to fit that size headphone jack.After about only a month, this phone 
would automatically shut off and restart itself every so often.I continued to use the phone 
for a bit longer,and this phone kept shutting off and restarting itself every 2-5 minutes 
or so,making the phone unusable.I will not be ordering this phone again in the future.
