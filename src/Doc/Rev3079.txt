The Z3 compact arrived and everything appears to look like a new device, box, screen 
cover and packaging. However the device is not assembled well and looks to be suspect 
as possibly not a new device from Sony.1. The outer bezel of the phone has 
an uneven gap around the edges2. When you squeeze the phone it flexes and clicks 
as if it is not tighly assembled3. It does not pass the water test application4. 
The phone was already configured, and has Chinese timezone and some Chinese app installed.I haven't 
contacted the seller yet, but I wanted to warn people asap as I think this 
may be a scam.
