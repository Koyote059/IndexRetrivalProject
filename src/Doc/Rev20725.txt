The phone is buttery smooth when it works, but issues with sd card and calling. 
Never recognized my Evo Samsung 32GB class 10. Callers can hear me but I couldn't 
hear them. it's a cellphone! Also getting too hot after limited use. Never had that 
with any of my other phones. Quality control seems to be lacking, I can't hope 
for luck. Had it for a weekend but it's going back.
