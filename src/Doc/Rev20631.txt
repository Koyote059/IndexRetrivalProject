We recd this phone today - and it was needed since the prior phone was 
damaged. I was shocked to see this phone come in a very generic box with 
a plastic insert that didn't really go w/the pieces inside. What was extremely disappointing was 
that there was some kind of gunk all over the front of it - and 
then the ear screen [where you put your ear] had some kind of gunk over 
the screen. Then the clincher -- although you could hear the other person on the 
line, they couldn't hear you. We took it our neighborhood Verizon store & was informed 
that this phone was just plane..bad..My first disappointment w/an Amazon vendor...so upset!..it's being returned 1st 
thing in the morning.
