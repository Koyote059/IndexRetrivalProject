I purchased two of these. One as a gift for a friend. They both had 
two similar issues. The touch screen would stop detecting touch and redetect. On Snapchat this 
would cause a line of dots to be drawn. The pre-placed screen protector exacerbated this 
issue and the problem was much more manageable once I removed the screen protector.The second 
issue both phones had was with Snapchat videos. They would encode incorrectly and look green 
and distorted. I spent weeks looking for a fix and apparently it's a common issue 
for this phone.I enjoyed my phone immensely apart from those two issues.The screen was clear. 
The battery was phenominal. And the camera was fine as well.I currently use the BLU 
life one x and would not recommend this phone, but the Life One X-- since 
they are similar prices.The final con of this phone-- it can't withstand a car door 
being shut on it.
