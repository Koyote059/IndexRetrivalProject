An instruction manual with no instructions in it. No customer service. No telephone number and 
no response to emails. The phone doesn't receive photos on your messaging app and after 
a few weeks wouldn't receive text messages either. Hours in the AT&T store with several 
calls to technical support but no one could help. The phone cost $200+ so it 
wasn't exactly a bargain either. This company WILL go out of business but they for 
all practical purposes non-existent already.
