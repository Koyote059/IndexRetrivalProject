Thanks PMG! the service was fast and painless. My sons Motorola 4th replacement became unstable 
after KitKat update but the Samsung Galaxy S4 works well KitKat. He thinks the hand 
motions are cool, but the best features are that it stays on as long as 
he is looking at it, and it has voice controls for everything. Calls have been 
clear and loud. I was afraid it would be flimsy with the plastic cover, but 
my son says it is very solid. PLUS, a phone with a removable battery and 
SD card?!? We purchased the phone from ProMobileGear and it was shipped as requested and 
in excellent quality. We would buy another phone from them if needed.
