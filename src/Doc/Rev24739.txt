The phone looks great, it works well, and the infrared port that allows it to 
be used as a remote control for so many devices is priceless. That being said, 
the speaker volume is very weak. I tried watching sports live, and it was difficult 
to hear anything if there were people nearby engaged in normal conversation. All of that 
I had read about in other reviews, so I am not surprised.What has surprised me 
very negatively, to the point that I almost give the phone a 3-star rating, is 
the "Gesture typing". What Sony calls their version of Swype. I have used Swype in 
a smaller screen (an LG myTouch) and a much larger screen (Kindle Fire HDX 8.9") 
for about two years, and BOTH are superior simply because they do not pretend to 
know more than you know about what you are typing.It annoys the hell out of 
me how it displays the word that you actually mean to type, and the instant 
you lift your finger it changes it to something else, absolutely different, for reasons totally 
unknown to me. For instance, I try to Swype "Delaware", and this thing simply comes 
up with "Eyewear", or "Eldar", or "Else" or a number of other words. Had I 
read about this I would NOT have bought this phone.
