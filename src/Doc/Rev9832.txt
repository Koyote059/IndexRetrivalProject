My stars are based upon it's price point. I can't attest that this phone is 
"as good" asthe higher end phones as some reviews suggest as I haven't tried those, 
but my guesswould be that paying extra you'd definitely get a better phone.Call quality is 
decent, camera could be a lot sharper. Only apps I really used werefor social media, 
didn't use it to surf the web much. After about a year and moreusage, battery 
life started getting much shorter and it seemed like the phone waslagging a lot more. 
Good size and weight, overall pretty durable.Bottom line: as far as software is concerned it's 
solid for the price. If you're aheavy user of web and apps you'll definitely want 
to pay more and geta more heavy-duty phone or else you'll be disappointed.
