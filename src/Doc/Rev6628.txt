I wasted my money. I should have bought the S4. That one at least has 
upgradeable memory. I bought the S6 with 32gb memory which is normally plenty of space. 
Or at least it would have been if there was a way to delete the 
crap you decide want or won't use. Otherwise it's okay; I like making individual ring 
tones and text tones and I like having my music and pics on it but 
there is no room for games. I am seriously considering downgrading.
