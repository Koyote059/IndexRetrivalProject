Beware - when buying, understand that this model DOES NOT support LTE, or even 3G, 
through most US GSM carriers (T-Mobile, AT&T, etc). I did not know this when I 
purchased it, and as a result was thoroughly disappointed. Fortunately Amazon's wonderful return policy saved 
me from everlasting woe, but still. Don't forget this.Other than that, the Exynos chip is 
generally faster than the standard Snapdragon 805 (which I have now, in my T-Mobile Note 
4), which makes this phone feel a bit newer than it is. And I mean, 
it is still a Note 4. Everything about it is excellent (screen, battery life, features, 
S Pen, camera). And I absolutely love the heart rate/SPO2 monitor. Super cool addition.
