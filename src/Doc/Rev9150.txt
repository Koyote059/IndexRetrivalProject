So far so good. This phone is great, the only problem I'm having is, where 
does the sd card go?I've read the Manuel, and cannot find a slot for the 
card.Can anyone help me?This phone us absolutely awesome. I use straight talk, and was surprised 
to learn its reconfigured itself to be AT &T, no problems so far.I'm so glad 
I read the reviews and bought it. You can't go wrong, this phone is worth 
every penny!!!
