The phone was excellent. I enjoyed the fact that the front facing camera had a 
flash and it worked really well. The only thing is that you couldn't use the 
front flash with snapchat which I didn't like. But it wasnt that big of a 
deal. I found out that has a notification LED, which was a big plus. I 
enjoy notification lights. The phone speed was really good, and there was no freezing/crashing. I 
would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good phone and for a great 
price.
