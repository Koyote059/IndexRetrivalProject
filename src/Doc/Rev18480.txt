There are a few things I don't love in the transition from the S3 to 
the S5. But there's no question it's a better phone. Everything was legitimate though if 
your just nervous about buying outside of a carrier as I was. I slipped in 
my t-mobile Sim card and everything worked. I do not however get 4glte. But to 
be honest I'm mostly on WiFi and have not noticed a real drop in quality 
on plain old 4G. I had it a month now. Battery life is so much 
better than my old phone ever was.
