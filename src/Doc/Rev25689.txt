I instantly fell in love with this item and it worked great it was wonderful 
that it was unlocked because I could get straight talk with it no contract or 
anything just $45 a month BUT after a couple of months it started to act 
up. Turns off by itself, Deleted messages just pop back up, closing out of apps 
on its own & there really is not enough space on this phone.. So pretty 
much I don't like the item anymore and will be needing a new phone.
