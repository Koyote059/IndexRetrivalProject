I bought this phone so I could answer text messages from my kids, grandkids and 
brothers without taking 3 minutes to text 3 words. At first I was a little 
concerned about the small buttons but I got used to them very quickly. I get 
much better reception than my old phone. I don't have to stop in my tracks 
when I'm in the store and my wife calls me to add to our grocery 
list. It did take almost the full 72 hours for Net10 to transfer my old 
phone number and minutes, but it was well worth the wait.
