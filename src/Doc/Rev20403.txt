I bought two of these phones for my husband and myself back in February. It 
only took a couple of days for his to stop working properly. It went dead 
one day and after he put it on the Charger it still wouldn't turn back 
on....then mine broke about a month after my purchase, the busted on it with very 
minor impact , for example like putting it in my purse and just walking around. 
With it for a couple of hours.... I continued to use it with a busted 
screen BC I couldn't afford. Repairs and finally about six months. After my purchases it 
finally knocked. Off and died too....and what little time it did work it would constantly 
go dead took hours to charge would die within3 mins and never had a bit 
of working. Speed....it always ran slow ands would ffreeze up. Final thought, I wasted over 
400$ on these. Phones and. I could have gotten better use out of a little 
toy phone then this phone! Worst phone I have ever seen before and very cheaply 
made!!!
