I love everything about this phone. It works perfect 95% of the time. The problem 
is that on occasion the media/main speaker on the back of the phone will turn 
off and all sound will emit from the small phone speaker on the screen side. 
This is fixable by restarting the phone which takes maybe 15 seconds tops. I love 
the screen size, its comparable to the iPhone 6. Very customizable interface, as Android always 
is. Never have a problem with apps closing or freezing. Long battery, especially with the 
power save option. With regular use (using apps, internet, GPS, calling and texting), I can 
make the battery last an entire weekend. Camera is also great quality, front and back, 
ans has a lot of built in editing. I would recommend this phone to anyone.
