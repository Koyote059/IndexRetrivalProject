The phone meets the quality standards of all Sony products, but I was only getting 
2G on metropcs. I had C6602 before getting this one, and my Internet was 3G, 
as fast as 4G LTE. You may want to check with your network provider if 
the C6603 unlocked is compatible with their 3G or 4G LTE. It's a great phone 
though.
