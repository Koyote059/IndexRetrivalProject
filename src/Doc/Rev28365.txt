I went from a hacked Note 3 that I was using, to this, and I 
have a few complaints, but overall I love it. Never used a google phone before 
this one.Pros:- suitably fast- fingerprint scanner- light- screen is nice- camera is decent and the 
default phone app is sufficient- matte backing is nice, but easily gets smudgy- build doesn't 
feel cheapCons:- 2GB is not enough ram. I'm feeling like I should have gone with 
the 6P instead because of this, but I didn't want that large of a screen 
anymore...- constantly unlocking my screen because of the thumbprint scanner when grabbing for it in 
my pocket...which might also be a positive- the USB-C format is highly annoying, but mostly 
because most chargers you buy are garbage and not regulated properly, and the charging cables 
aren't really used except for this device right now. This means you have to buy 
MORE cables (and I'm sure you have 100 USB-A MicroUSB cables now) or buy an 
adapter, and google doesn't really provide them properly. Also, no first party car chargers that 
I could find that also charge another device. There are some on amazon, however.- the 
phone gets really hot with some apps, to the point of rebooting on long playtimes. 
It gets hot in general.- doesn't say Nexus 5X on the back.- CPU could be 
a bit more powerfulOverall, I'm satisfied for what's clearly a slight downgrade from the Note 
3, but for the price, it's worth it if you're in the market for a 
cheap phone that isn't a "phablet".
