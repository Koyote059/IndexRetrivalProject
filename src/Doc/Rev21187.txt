I've been using this phone since June 2013 and it works perfectly fine since! All 
the features works and the touchscreen is very responsive, although, I suggest you buy a 
screen protector if you don't want to get any stratches on there. The only downside 
I see to this phone is the thickness of it and removing the back panel 
is a bit testing as you have to apply some force to your camera/led flash. 
Being a mid-range smartphone, a plus is that it features NFC capabilities. The battery life 
for this phone is also amazing (compared to other rivals at the same price range).

Windows 8/8.1 OS better than Android/iOS, I suggest you buy this phone, one of the 
best smartphones you can get for the price; happy buying!
