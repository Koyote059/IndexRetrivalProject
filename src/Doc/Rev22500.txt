It's a good phone for the price but here are some weird cons that could 
be deal breaker for you potentially:1. The home key, back button, and tasks bar are 
touch buttons on the bottom of the. This poses a problem when typing because the 
space bar is just above the home button. So frequently, you may accidentally hit the 
home button rather then space bar, which consequently send you to the home screen. Can 
be quite frustrating and hard to get used too.2. No fault to ASUS, but there 
aren't very many cases or accessories for this phone and, when looking, you must be 
cautious to look for the exact model number. Asus made a few different versions of 
this phone that have differences that effect most accessories.3. The rear loud speaker's sound quality 
isn't very good for music.A few nuisances, but like I stated earlier, this is a 
good performing phone for the price.
