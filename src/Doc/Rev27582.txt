Since 2007 when smart phones first debuted, I have owned 3 iPhones, 7 Samsung phones, 
and one HTC phone. This was my first LG phone, and I must say that 
I am very impressed. It is the best smart phone Iâve ever owned. It is 
superior the Samsung phones Iâve had in almost every way. First of all the screen 
is clear and brighter than my Samsung Galaxy phone. The menus are laid out far 
better than my Galaxy phone, and even have nice features like a setting that allows 
you to adjust for apps that only occupy a portion of the screen because of 
aspect ratio problems. It allows you to adjust those apps so they take up the 
full-screen. Battery life may be one of the areas that's lacking, and I have this 
complaint with many phones. And most importantly, this phone actually allows me to delete things 
from my own SD memory card. My Samsung android phone with version 4.4 would NOT 
allow me to delete files that I put on my own memory card. But this 
LG works perfectly on android 4.1.2. Overall an excellent phone.
