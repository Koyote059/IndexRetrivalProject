THE GOOD The BlackBerry Classic couples a comfortable, accurate keyboard with an attractive design that's 
sure to please BlackBerry fans. Support for Android apps will please the rest of us, 
too.THE BAD The spacious four-row keyboard results in a smaller, cramped screen.THE BOTTOM LINE If 
you're willing to trade screen size for a superior physical keyboard, the BlackBerry Classic is 
a fantastic productivity phone for old-school QWERTY junkies.
