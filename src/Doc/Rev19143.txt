The iPhone 5s is a great phone that's surprisingly user-friendly and has plenty of nifty 
features. The camera takes excellent quality photos and videos and it meets all my social 
media and navigation needs. My only complaint is 16GB fills up FAST if you take 
a lot of photos. Other than that, it's been fantastic. I've had it for a 
year and I expect to have it for years to come (for one because the 
iPhone 6 is HUGE, and I like the size of the 5s).
