phone was working fine. after a year and a half it stoppd working. don't know 
if its the battery or what, will send to sony to try and fix. a 
phone shouldn't die after that time. nothing happened to it, just stopped. Sony is taking 
no responsibility. service is through mail, very unfriendly. better to either get a cheaper phone 
that you don't expect to be reliable, or an expensive one but NOT Sony. don't 
waste your money.
