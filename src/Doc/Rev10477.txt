I have had the phone for a couple weeks now and am only giving it 
3 stars. I wish the phone ear speaker was louder when on calls. I can 
barely hear some people and it can't be turned up any louder. My biggest complaint 
though is that the phone keeps dropping in and out of wifi at home and 
work. I have no problems with my other devices consistently staying on my wifi. Frustrating. 
I have contacted the support line on this issue. no response back yet.Other than that, 
speed is good. no lag.
