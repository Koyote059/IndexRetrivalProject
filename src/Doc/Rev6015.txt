This phone had a few obvious scratches on the face, which were not described on 
the description of the device. However, it was the glitches thereafter that were disappointing. Within 
2 weeks, the speaker function stopped working. I have had the phone since March 2013 
and have issues with my 3-way calling feature. I have to turn the phone off...then 
back on for the conference calling function to work. Lastly, the volume button on the 
side that mutes the phone has malfunctioned causing the phone to ring when it should 
be silenced. We pay for what we get...and this used phone has made me leary 
of ever purchasing another one.
