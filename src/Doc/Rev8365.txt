Worst phone I ever bought. Does not get good reception. Every other phone I've had 
has always gotten good reception where I live. Extremly poor download speeds. Will not load 
videos or pictures from texts or facebook. The phone that was delivered to me also 
has a spot on the screen that will not go away. If I could afford 
a real galaxy phone I would purchase one but being a single grandmother raising 3 
grandchildren well that isn't an opption. Signed a truely dissapointed customer.
