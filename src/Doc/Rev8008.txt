The BlackBerry Curve 8520 smartphone fits neatly in your hand, and comes with a full 
QWERTY keyboard that makes typing and sending messages easy, and comfortable. The bright screen displays

a laptop, the trackpad lets you scroll through menus, icons, and information by gliding your 
finger over it. Press and click to select an item and navigate to where you 
want to go. Control music and multimedia with dedicated media keys found atop the new 
BlackBerry Curve 8520 smartphone. Skip over songs, pause music to talk, or repeat your favorites 
over and over. You can even mute phone calls with the easy-access mute button.
