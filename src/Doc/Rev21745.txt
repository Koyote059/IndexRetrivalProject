Beautiful phone...and great performance...this phone handles all I could throw at it so far...I'm a 
game freak and for me a phone ought to be able to handle games like 
asphalt 8 in full graphic settings with no problem...so far, no problem...the game loads very 
fast and very smoothly(a few slow drop frames ever so often)...the screen is a beauty 
to watch...To answer some questions that I know some may have:1) There aren't any LED 
notification lights (to me that's minor)although that would have added to its flare considering the 
size of the bezel on top...2) Of the 8 gb, 6.13 is available for storage 
and it easily increases via micro sd...I am using a 32 GB samsung micro sdhc 
card and there were no problems in its recognition by the device...I've selected the option 
of using the micro sd as default storage but I noticed that certain apps can't 
help but be installed in some way on the internal memory of the phone...as a 
result, a little more of the internal memory will be used...but only a little...before that 
I had an atrix 2 with 8 GB of rated internal memory(about 5.5 GB of 
actual memory) and I could not, as an option, install apps to the sd without 
rooting the phone...even then, it was problematic...but the gigs I had were more than enough 
still for several large games at the same time like asphalt 7 and 8, modern 
combat 3 and the like...so far I've been able to install asphalt 8 on the 
card(the whole of it)...decided to re-download some others as well...so I don't expect any storage 
problems unless I try to download and install more than 15 large apps...3) It is 
very efficient on RAM with no bloatware: I had over fourteen apps open at the 
same time including asphalt 8, netflix, facebook, and almost half of the RAM still available 
when I checked (makes me wonder what would have happened if they gave this 2 
Gigs of RAM as I know some people suggested)...the 1 Gig so far is more 
than enough...I suspect the 8 cores are making RAM usage much more efficient...4) Of the 
two sims, one is mini (regular sized) sim and the other is micro sized...they were 
very easy to install and once both sims are installed you get the option of 
making one sim your default for calls, texts, or data (each separately- sim 1 can 
be used for calls only if you desire while sim 2 could be used for 
the other aspects) Sim 1 is the micro sim...additionally, I don't know if it's just 
me but the battery seemed to drain a little faster when only one sim was 
installed...I haven't really investigated further so not sure...just something to keep in mind...5) Android 4.4 
has been dished out...seems to have come out on the 24th of the month...was skeptical 
to upgrade since no announcement was made on BLU's facebook page or even the website 
was down for some time...but I decided to try it...it's official...just had to be patient 
during the upgrade process and not interrupt in any way...so far, the phone feels much 
more fluid than before...nothing extra special noticed as yet...of course, I'll be playing around with 
it some...6) The battery life is acceptable at best I think. This is to me 
the thing I like the least about this phone. In standby the battery will last 
mind you, but once you're using it to, let's say, instant message via whatsapp and 
facebook with a little gaming and music in-between, you'll get around 6 - 7 hours...that's 
what I've seen so far...since it's an 8-core processor with mediatek, I was expecting stellar 
battery life...but screen on time hasn't impressed me much in as much as it is 
limited to within 12 hours instead of within 24 hours...they could have done alot better 
with the battery...hopefully the update will make better use of battery or maybe they could 
create a better 2000 mah or perhaps a larger mah (2500 mah) battery to fit 
the phone...(still, consider the price...it is better or as good as many other devices out 
there at the same price)7) The speaker is very clear and clean...loud enough too for 
my liking and the phone itself comes with a beautiful music player that offers several 
sound effects like 'plate reverb', 'large room' etc along with different play modes like classical, 
dance, hip hop, pop, etc...I said before that 'I don't feel the desire to get 
another player from google play store' but I redownloaded fusion music player which allows users 
to cut a song at any point to make a desired ringtone(it also allows online 
content and other useful features so...)...With respect to the speakers though, I do think that 
they probably could have placed it at the front considering how much bezel that is 
present below the capacitive buttons or they could have placed a smaller one there...but it 
works well on the back nonetheless...(lean it onto something solid when playing videos and the 
sound resounds beautifully)8) The WI-FI antennae seems pretty strong...I was travelling around with this and 
it's been picking up WI-FI signals from homes as I passed by with more than 
a few bars...it connected to my home WI-FI very quickly...9) Call quality is very good...I 
only made a few short calls so far but individuals hear me clearly and they 
sound clearly also with no background noise and no drop calls...so far so good. There 
is a setting that allows me to suppress my background noise during calls too.10) Both 
cameras function well and take clear pictures...the flash on the back is bright enough to 
take good pictures at night...the interface is minimalistic and clean...one issue is that whenever the 
video icon is touched the camera automatically starts recording video...don't know if I can change 
this in the settings yet but I'll keep looking into it...11) I haven't tried out 
the bluetooth as yet so I can't say how stable it is in use yet...12) 
The headphones aren't so special...don't expect to experience the best sounds from them but they 
are good enough and come with a mic...13) Something I noticed is that when using 
the screen for typing I sometimes have to press the same area 2-3 times or 
wait for a second or two to get a letter out...I went into audio settings 
and disabled the vibration feedback and it helped a little but it still happens though 
less frequently...it's therefore one of two things: (i) It's a software problem which can be 
fixed with the update or (ii) My particular phone has a minor fault...still this doesn't 
take away from the usability of the phone since it only happens ever so often 
and lasts for 2-3 seconds...14) I ran antutu benchmark several times and the highest score 
I ever got was 28,887...RAM usage is great and shows up better than most phones 
in comparison (3084 vs 1387 on the galaxy s4)...15) It may take some time to 
get used to the position of the capacitive buttons...their background light goes off after only 
a few seconds without interaction and I sometimes had to search a bit for them...in 
a well lit area, there isn't a problem seeing them without their background light on...I 
think that we should be allowed to change how long they light up for though...hopefully 
that is included in the update...All-in-all this phone works...and there is no need to pay 
400-700 us dollars on a brand phone like Samsung or HTC when you have blu 
coming through with so much to offer at an acceptable price...compared to the moto g 
at the same price you get alot more value for money.UPDATE(Dec-15-2014): I've been using the 
phone for a few months with minor issues until now: I'm finally in a position 
to really try the bluetooth but so far I'm very disappointed; I've tried it with 
several bluetooth devices and am yet to get a stable connection...that sucks since I really 
use bluetooth of recent including my computer which works just fine with the bluetooth usb 
device I ordered from Inateck. Other than the bluetooth, another issue I think needs be 
resolved is the lack of ability to make the power button a camera snapper (and 
the pictures are amazing btw)...sometimes it's hard to snap oneself having to search for the 
exact point on the screen to touch with ones finger...in addition, it seems to change 
settings every now and then with regards to my music ringtones (though I suspect my 
music app may have something to do with that): the ringtone I use changes on 
its own for whatever reason.I hope BLU resolves all these issues because with all these 
things I don't think this phone is worth the $200 they are asking for- especially 
considering that other phones in their line-up are cheaper without these issues. So I'm bringing 
down my rating to a 3 until I see reason to do otherwise.
