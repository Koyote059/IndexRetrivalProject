DO NOT TRUST this product on this seller.I bought TWO WEEKS AGO and the device 
showed:1.) problems with fingerprint lock. Basically this feature adds 30 seconds of waiting time before 
using your phone, since it consistenly does not work, and it locks your phone after 
3 tries.2.) Phone would consistenly freeze (once a day) with the watch on. The only 
solution is restaring the phone. and the freezed clock is an extra because it made 
me lose a few meetings.3.) "unbreakle glass" screen broke after ONE WEEK OF USE, in 
my FRONT pocket, without never even even falling on the flor. it was ONE SINGLE 
coin that made the damage.
