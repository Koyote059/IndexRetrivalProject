i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my 
thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs 
though. They are involved with Dr Dre now and I heard they are going to 
make bigger phones, something Steve Jobs was against. Guess we will see.
