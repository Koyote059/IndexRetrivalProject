Some small scratches on the corners and the AT&T guy pointed out that there is 
a small gap between the front and back of the phone (I hadn't even noticed), 
but all of that is more than worth how much money I saved by getting 
this phone second-hand. Highly recommend this over getting a brand new phone.
