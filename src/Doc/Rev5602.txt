First let me identify the seller "Phone-Zone". So many people complain about a seller, but 
they don't give the name.First the phone (IPhone 5s) took longer than normal to get 
here, but the weathers been bad, so ok. The real problem was that while everything 
stated by the seller and Amazon on the website, receipt and labeling, implied that the 
phone was new and T-Mobile ready, is now in doubt. I was unable to activate 
the phone with my carrier T-Mobile because the SIM was unusable or not installed. After 
some trouble I was able to get the SIM cover off, and there was a 
T-Mobile SIM installed. So the SIM is either defective or had been activated before. So 
no phone.I am driving the 30 miles to my local T-Mobile store tomorrow, to try 
and get the phone working, and to find out its history. I'm hoping they're good 
with IPhones, because while working over the phone with T-Mobile to resolve the problem, the 
SIM card became jammed in the IPhone (poor design). SO NO PHONE!When you spend the 
kind of money Apple asks for their products, you expect more. I've owned three Apple 
products, including this one, and had problems with two of the three. That's Not Good.Overall, 
I give the 5s just 2 stars and the seller Phone-Zone 0 stars.
