Been using this phone for over 2 weeks now and I have to say I'm 
really satisfied. Works great, love the almost stock android, the fingerprint detector is really fast 
and having a turbo power charger has changed my life so that was also great 
(from 40 to over 80 in 30 mins).I did not test the camera yet but 
it opens really fast and seems easy to use; my only critique is that the 
design of the phone is nothing special but if you're gonna put a case on 
the phone (which most of us do) this is no longer a concearn.
