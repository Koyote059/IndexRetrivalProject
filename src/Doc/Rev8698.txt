The phone is great. The screen is outstanding. The feel of the phone in my 
hand is the best Iâve felt, itâs perfect. Iâm coming from an HTC one M8 
windows phone and before that I had a Lumia 1520 and other windows phones before 
that. This is by far the best so far.Iâm in the USA on AT&T and 
the lack of LTE is not a problem at all, the H+ that Iâm getting 
seems just as fast. Iâm usually on Wi-Fi anyway so the cell speed is not 
noticeable to me.I only gave the phone 4 stars because of an issue I had 
and you should be aware of. The phone was branded to a carrier in the 
UK, EE I think it was. They block Group Texting and Iâm a big user 
of group texting. It was really frustrating when I first discovered that I couldnât do 
group texting with my new phone. After a lot of research I decided that I 
would have to replace the firmware with an unbranded copy so I could get group 
texting. Replacing the phones firmware is not hard but itâs not for the faint of 
heart either. You have to have some technical abilities to do it. Itâs also possible 
that you will get a branded phone from some other carrier that disables some other 
feature, itâs really a crap shoot what youâre going to get.If you donât mind living 
without some features or youâre up to replacing the firmware then I highly recommend this 
phone, it really is the best Iâve seen yet.You can find instructions for replacing the 
firmware here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2515453 or quite a few other places, just do a search on Bing 
or Google.
