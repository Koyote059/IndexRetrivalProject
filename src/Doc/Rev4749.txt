I got this product and it worked good for the 1st hour then the watch 
stopped connecting to my phone and the screen changed colors as if the led was 
going out and then just shut off. I tried to plug it in the charge 
I thinking it was low on battery but it wasn't. It did come back on 
but then I was done with messing with it so returned it. I recommend spending 
more money on a better smart watch. You definitely get what you pay for with 
smart watches don't go cheap!
