I bought one of these for a 9 year old and 8 year old. They 
do work. Have not used the radio yet. We have texted and called. I think 
the sound on it is pretty good. It was a little loose on the younger 
child but to be expected. On the last hole, it is wearable. The stylus is 
very helpful and stays put in the band. One of them broke as I pulled 
it out. I super glued it back and is fine. I have to agree that 
the little user manual doesn't say much at all. But the interface was so easy, 
you can pretty much set it up without it. Also, the ear buds are pretty 
cheap and one has broken, but the cat might have gotten it! The important thing 
is that the kids loved it and it works quite well for them. I used 
a t mobile SIM card and I bought some prepaid minutes with it, won't work 
without them.
