First off I am not a power smartphone user-- i rarely use youtube, I do 
not play games on my phone, I use it for texting, talking, checking the weather 
/ stock market / news, and i run an antivirus program on it. I use 
it to take casual photos and send them via texting. I bought this phone about 
8 months ago, loving it, loving BOOST. My $55/month has dropped to $50 month an 
in another 4 months will drop to $45 a month for unlimited everything. I love 
the small size of this phone--not much of a problem because the AI when speaking 
to convert speech to text is pretty good. Sleek geeky color scheme including backside which 
is a texttured grunge black. single core gives it good battery life-- and i just 
plug it in to charge when i home and look at it as a land 
line at home and then unplug it and use it all day out and about. 
I use Amazon for getting my android apps, I just prefer to stay off all 
things Google, but when you first start the phone upon buying it Google will of 
course want you to sign up with a Google account; your choice, google or amazon 
or you could also just find android apps (.apk) on the web but then you 
take your changes they might have malware embedded in them. I prefer Amazon as zon 
already knows everything about me, so, you know. So nice overall smartphone if you are 
not a poweruser. If you need 4G or are heavy into videos (this phone plays 
videos of course, and music) or gaming on a phone, you might want a dual 
core phone with a larger screen.
