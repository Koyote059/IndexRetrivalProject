This phone is for music lovers right? Speakers are good but my Bluetooth is horrible 
I put the phone in my pocket and simply turn around and my Bluetooth speaker 
will cut out don't have that problem with other phones anyone else have this problem? 
Did drop the phone once before I activated it though. Hitting the power and volume 
down at the same time will do a screenshot which seems almost unavoidable and it 
happens all the time and is really getting on my nerves hell my home screen 
freaked out or so I thought until I realized I was looking at a s***load 
of screenshots can't find an option the disable this feature yet. The cameras focus is 
horrible compared to my old Moto E and my Samsung Avant. Something about unlocking the 
screen and about the way the notifications work has really been annoying. I going to 
fix my old samsung Avant a throw this one in the trash if I can't 
find an easy fix for most of these issues
