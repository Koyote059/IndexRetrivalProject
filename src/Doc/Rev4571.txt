Love this phone! It is fast. Camera is better than the last phone ( galaxy 
light). It is slick looking. Battery life is the same as previous phone,it dies by 
end of day (evening). I charge it overnight. No improvement as far as battery. All 
in all, Great phone!! Perfect size, fast, decent camera , and slick looking! Would recommend!! 
Also has a heart monitor..
