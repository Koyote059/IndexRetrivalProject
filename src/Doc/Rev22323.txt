I bought this phone knowing that it did not have a warranty, but still expected 
it to at least boot up first time. Shock on me. The 'X' boot up 
logo appeared and that was it. Removed the battery and tried it again. This time, 
with the 'X' boot up logo appearing and disappearing like it was in a reboot 
loop.I unfortunately cannot return the phone (bought by a friend in the US and shipped 
outside) and the costs and trouble involved in returning it would probably buy my wife 
another phone (initially was for my wife).I have previously bought an HTC Desire via Amazon 
(wasn't even new) and that is still running smoothly (albeit with a custom ROM - 
CM7.1) so I have some experience flashing ROMs etc. I just thought I'd see how 
the stock ROM would work since the phone is for my wife.After several hours I 
finally managed to get HTC image ver 2.3.3 for the nexus one ( from the 
HTC Dev website) which somehow worked after some times. Then the OTA updates started coming 
in. I opted to manually do the updates initially but for 2.3.6 tried to do 
it OTA, which resulted in the reboots starting again. Reflashed 2.3.3 and then this time 
did 2.3.4 and 2.3.6 manually. A few hours later, tried using latitude and phone reboots 
(!!), then another time added a power control widget to the screen and it boots 
again, with the reboot loop! by this time I had discovered that removing the battery 
for some time will allow the phone to boot properly.So 3 stars off for the 
whole experience, but 1.5 stars since I bought the phone without warranty and the 0.5 
star is because I try to be positiven...
