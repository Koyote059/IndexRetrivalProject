This iPhone gives me nostalgia, but not because of it's "retro" design remembering the 5s. 
It feels nostalgic because 10 years ago I used to carry similar sized digital cameras 
to capture my life in photos.When smartphones became more powerful with better cameras I still 
waited because they still lagged in a few things and getting a small point and 
shoot was still a much better value for money.The SE makes the iPhone devices 'more 
affordable' and it is the smartphone that has finally convinced me to "upgrade" my portable 
photography philosophy to use it as my only camera for everything. The pictures are clear, 
beautiful, they are much better in low light than with point and shoot cameras, the 
camera app is super easy, and the shutter is fast fast fast. That was I 
was looking for.Speaking about software, wow what can I say that hasn't been told already? 
iOS is very fluid and minimalist, with no bloatware, something I appreciate A LOT. With 
Android, even with high end devices, you still feel some hicups and lag from time 
to time, but iOS is the king of "smoothness". I've even seen 5 years old 
iPhone devices working still like the first time.I don't care about the screen being smaller 
than other smartphones nowadays, because I don't watch much video on my phones, I'm minimalist 
so I just keep a few apps for messaging and photos and that's it.The battery 
life is great, but charging takes like 1.5 hours.Typing is something that will take me 
a few more days to get used to, coming from a 5 inches screen, but 
it is something I can live with.
