Works well. The parents and I all purchased this phone. I had to purchase another 
phone due to the charging port breaking internally. It was probably my own fault but 
I ended up purchasing another phone that had a little more strength to it. functionally 
it worked great. Only slowed down when running Pandora, fb, craigslist in background and games.
