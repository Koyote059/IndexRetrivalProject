Oh boy! Well what can I say. This is my second Blu studio 7.0 so 
when my first hot damage I didn't hesitate buying my new Blu studio LTE 7.0 
phone in August of this year yes the first one wasn't perfect had to use 
it with a headphone or on speakers as the audio wasn't great that said. As 
soon as I open it I fell in love.....but try turning it on wasn't happening 
thought it needed to be charged sigh of relief short lived it was already fully 
charged so why is it not turning on? First of my long list of worries 
I'll only name a few...... It sticks with every app.....the phone rings I missed the 
call phone not responding to touch.....oh I tried adding names to my contact good luck 
with that as the next time I need same number it's nowhere to be found....it 
blacks out all the time and oh it never stops downloading and even with a 
memory card I'm running out of space....super slow I could go on and on. Yes 
I was offered back some of my money so I would send back this phone 
and I'd wait for maybe a week and a half to maybe two weeks for 
a new one.....I emailed the seller who asked for the order number I sent it 
immediately they haven't replied. Here's my review hope this helps
