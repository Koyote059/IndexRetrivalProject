I like it some what but it comes with very little operating instructions so some 
things are hard to figure out. You have to down load the 108 page instruction 
manual.Recently I have found that the battery life doesn't hold for even 24 hrs not 
happy about that at allCan't get the sound of receiving texts changed shows one sound 
does anotherI would look around before totally deciding on this one first.Its not bad depends 
what you want to do with it.
