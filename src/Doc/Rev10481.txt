The best smartwatch for the money. Customer service is 5 star.I easily paired the GTO8 
with my Android LG G Vista smartphone via bluetooth. I downloaded the BT Notification and 
and Smartwear apps from Google Play. From the Smartwear, you can determine which apps on 
your phone you'd like to see or get notifications from on the GT08.You can easily 
go back to Smartwear and uncheck apps that show up too often (e.g. weather) or 
don't apply.The watch face is a bit large. OK for me, but for slender wrists, 
it might seem large.I like the large face. You can easily see and read notifications 
not to mention use the multiple functions the watch offers.The first time I received a 
phone call on the GT08 proved this watch was worth the purchase. My phone was 
in my pocket while the watch gave out a nice but loud enough alarm of 
an incoming call. The watch phone screen was on and all I did was hit 
the green OK/Accept button. I could hear the caller quite clearly and she could hear 
me as well (the microphone is on the left bottom side of the watch). Wonderful!
