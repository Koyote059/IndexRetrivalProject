Brilliant!Came in the box. Has a nice sticker over the side that states "Do not 
accept if seal is broken"Inside the box is a shiny new S5 SM-900FD phone with 
all the plastic still in place.Under that is the SN and ID data sheet / 
sticker... (don't loose).Under that a quick start guide.Below that you find the Charger (Euro), cables, 
earbuds and a Euro to US plug adapter for the charger. But since its basically 
a USB adapter any USB Phone charger 'should' work fine (check the voltages though).Some people 
seem to have been confused by the Euro charger. Im guessing the term "International" didn't 
quite hit home for them.The screen is untouched, the back is untouched and apart from 
the addition of the US adapter its a perfectly fine almost straight from the factory 
box.Just make sure you check the UPC on the box "Before" you break the seal.My 
only quibble is the packaging.. No kind of bubble wrap or shock material at all. 
The package was snug around the box so it didn't "bounce around" in the box. 
But there was little in the way of shock absorbing materials. UPS delivered the package 
un molested though.
