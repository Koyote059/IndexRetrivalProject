I have an iPhone, a OnePlus One and a new BlackBerry. But this is my 
best phone so far, unlike my android phone, I don't catch myself fiddling around with 
anything, it works very well, this device surprised me considering its price. The battery is 
large enough to give me a full active day including about an hour of Internet 
sharing. Windows Mobile is on the right track, It is fun to use, 8.1 is 
not perfect but Widows 10 Mobile should fix most of my small issues. It has 
become my main phone.
