This phone just blows your other phones out of the water. It quite literally is 
the best phone out there. If you buy itbrand new, international, Amazon is kind enough 
to include an adapter for the phone for wherever they are shipping the device to. 
The phone, brand new takesa few updates that'll take take around 3 hours to finish, 
but once you're done, it's Marshmallow(latest Android update) heaven baby. The phone, despite being a 
last generation Xperia Device can take anything you throw at it. Any app, any game, 
it'll heat up to a point, but not enough to shut it down or damage 
the device. Heat is only natural for these devices as there are no other ways 
to disperse the heat besides the built in heat sinks. And the heat is not 
a bad thing, that just means your phone is doing work.I give this phone a 
5/5 for now let's wait for the upcoming weeks.
