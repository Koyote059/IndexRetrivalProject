Received phone and it already had issues. Sim card for T-mobile did not work and 
it killed it a second time when I tried to put in. Screen keeps going 
black when trying to call someone and it wont hangup. Also screen sleeps after double 
tap but double tap not working for wake up. Did all troubleshooting even resetting and 
erasing cache for it. Still not working. Installed the tempered glass on it and it 
just would not wake for screen. Returning phone since it was already having issues and 
I needs a phone with dual sim to work correctly. Asus need to fix these 
problems before they sell this. It would of been a good phone if it worked. 
So disappointing since I have many Asus products.
