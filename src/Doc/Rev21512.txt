After few months with this phone I can say that I love it. But the 
phone started just crashing all the time. No more updates were available for it. The 
screen resolutions is awesome, the camera is decent, easy to use, very thin. I ended 
up getting another phone and will have this one as a backup.Not worth the $$ 
IMO.
