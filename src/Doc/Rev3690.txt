I like how sleek it is. I've had it for almost a year, just recently 
started turning off randomly (hoping the new battery will work) Also I found that I 
had to take out the battery a every once in a while because it will 
freeze or something, and I really don't have apps, I use it for messaging, picture 
taking and call purposes mainly. Good for that, but I guess I don't need a 
'fancy' phone like this.
