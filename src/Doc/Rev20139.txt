The phone looks great, all functions seem to be OK. However, the camera only looks 
good without zoom in. Compared with Nexus 5, which zooms up to 4 times and 
still sharp, this Z1 camera's zoom in function is simply cheating. It magnifies the image 
4 times without re-focusing. Any image under zoom in is blurry. The price is too 
high for such a built-in camera.Other comments: the battery lasts 2 days, which is good. 
But it increased the size dramatically, so compared with Nexus 5, this phone it too 
big in hand. The external charging function is a good feature.If you want a good 
phone and never owned Nexus 5, you should change your focus from this point.
