After reading all the hype about the S3 that just came out, I wasn't sure 
if I would be happy with a "lesser" model. Plus I have been lusting over 
the huge screen on the Galaxy Note, and wondering whether to buy one of those. 
I am happy to say that I cannot imagine being happier with either of those 
two phones. This phone is amazing - it's fast, it has a wonderful display, and 
the voice recognition software is excellent. The seller did a great job of shipping the 
phone and the phone arrived exactly as advertised.The only problem I had was with AT&T. 
I live & work in Egypt and came home for the summer. So I went 
to AT&T with an older phone (the S2 had not yet arrived) and asked for 
a SIM card and whatever plan they could give me to keep me connected for 
the next two months. They hooked me up with GoPhone and said I could add 
the data plan when my new phone arrived. When I got the S2 I put 
in the SIM card and called AT&T to add a data plan. After about 12 
hours I still couldn't connect, so I called AT&T - they said that since this 
is a 4G phone they had no 4G data plan through GoPhone. So I went 
to the local AT&T store, where it took an hour to get hooked up with 
a regular account and not lose the money I had already spent. I finally learned 
that I could have gone to several other pay-as-you-go carriers for about half the price. 
Needless to say, when the summer is over I will not be interested in working 
with AT&T again.The only other complaint is the crapware AT&T adds to the phone - 
I'll have to do some research to see how to get rid of it; they 
don't offer an uninstall feature for most of it.Bottom line is this phone is everything 
I hoped it would be and more - I recommend it highly. Samsung, great job. 
AT&T - you seriously need to get your act together.
