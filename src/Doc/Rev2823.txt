Purchased as a gift for my 12 year old daughter. Functions perfectly, is durable (I 
watch her drop it regularly), and does everything she wants it to do. Only negative 
is we had to take it to AT&T for problems with it burning through 10 
gigs of data in TWO WEEKS! It is better since, but still heavy on the 
data usage, even when using wifi. I have been told this is a known issue 
with this model. Other than that, it's her best friend.
