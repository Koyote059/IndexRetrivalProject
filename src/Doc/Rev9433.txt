My boyfriend has had his Note 3 for a couple of years, and loves his, 
so I got the same model. While walking together, I noticed my GPS was a 
bit off in comparison to his. This could be due to the fact that mine 
was unlocked and originally for a different carrier, so some wonkiness is to be expected.
