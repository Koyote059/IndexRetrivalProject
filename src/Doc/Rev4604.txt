I mean when I got a new phone it came with the original box that 
contain charger, battery, the instruction booklet and the warranty paper, but this order that I 
got it had the battery charger and the phone which isn't in its original box. 
I know I shouldn't complain about it because you get what you pay. But when 
I order it said NEW PHONE so to my understanding that a NEW phone means 
its in the original box. When its refurbish phone just say it's a refurbish phone 
that way people know what they are getting.
