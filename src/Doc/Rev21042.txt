Broke my previous phone (Nexus 4) and was in need of a new one quickly. 
My sister has a Google Nexus 5 as well so she recommended this phone to 
me. This was my first experience buying a refurbished phone and I am very satisfied 
with the quality. The phone came in a new box with all accessories included. Although, 
my sister noted that the charger is different and not the original charger that she 
got when she bought her Google Nexus 5. However, I've been using it for a 
few months now and haven't have any problem with the charger. It charges quickly. The 
wall unit is a little bigger than I would like but no major concern. Everything 
was wrapped really well and phone was clean with no scratches. I wouldn't have thought 
this was a refurbished if I didn't already know. Everything just looks so new and 
clean. I've been using it for a couple of months now. The battery doesn't last 
as long as I would like it to. It lasts me half a day if 
I'm using it a lot or playing games. But if I'm just calling and texting, 
it will lasts the entire day. Other than that, I haven't had any problems. The 
back of the Nexus 4 is made of glass so it would crack whenever I 
dropped out. The back of this phone is more plastic and less glass so hopefully, 
I won't have that problem.
