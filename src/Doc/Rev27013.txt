Great phone, love the form factor, those super slim bezels are fantastic. After 3 weeks 
of usage my only two complaints are the phone gets really hot really easily I'm 
guessing they didn't find a way to optimize the QHD screen with the battery. And 
2 while the phone looks great, it's super light plastic so any drop and it 
dents and scratches really easily so you def need a case or skin on it. 
Camera is basic coming from a Samsung, not alot of options or extras but photos 
are generally very nice, overall UI is good no large amounts of bloatware, I absolutely 
love knock code all phones should have this, especially to go straight into guest mode, 
simply brilliant. Samsung has more apps available for split screen and it does seem on 
the whole like LG has been copying Samsung in terms of its multitasking and UI 
features and lagging alittle behind in the implementation. Overall I give this phone 4 starts 
for the gorgeous QHD screen (though I still miss amoled) brilliant form factor and solid 
battery life
