No they did not meet my review nor my standard because AT&T lock me out 
of their phone because I was not using thier services.They determinated my phone and disable 
the system because I did not have their servce, All I want too was used 
their phone and buy service from another provider I just like that phone because it 
was a flip phone but they disable me and I was without service for a 
month and then I bought another phone just like this one and start using it 
after about 3weeks they disable that phone so I bought batteries because I thought that 
was the problem but it was not they wanted me to get service from them 
in order to use their phone. I did not want AT&T service I want consumer 
cellular because I am a senior citizen but they did not want that so they 
disable my service and I had no phone for about a month. so I bought 
a phone from cousumer Cellular and got my service back up. That was pretty dirty 
and low down.
