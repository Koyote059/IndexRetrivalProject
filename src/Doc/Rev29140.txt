Good phone. Keep in mind it is a GSM Network phone, so be sure to 
chose a phone and Network that best suited for the area you will use it 
the most. The only drawback I have with this phone is; I want to use 
the shortcut key (left, right, up, down) to access the Messaging folder, and I have 
not been able to do that from the shortcut keys. I do like the light 
weight and slim feel of the phone. For the money I think I made a 
good buy.
