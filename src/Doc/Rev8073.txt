The phone is great but at first it worked well like for 6hrs and after 
that I noticed whenever I am texting someone it keep saying CAN'T SEND MESSAGE. I 
tried everything to fix it but it does not want to send my text messages 
to my friends. The battery life does not run long. Another problem the audio. When 
I put it on speaker mode the voice of the other person on the other 
line sounds choppy or static although the reception is 100%. So I decided to send 
it back less than 24hrs via UPS!
