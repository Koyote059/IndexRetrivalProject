It's huge!!! Way too big! Even bigger than the iPhone 6s PLUS!!! It's size makes 
it rather inconvenient as it can't fit in anything. The camera has surprisingly low quality, 
considering the Polaroid brand is commonly a camera manufacturer. I had the phone for about 
4 months before I bumped it on a corner and the whole screen became pixelated. 
From then on, the screen had all these little lines across it that wouldn't disappear. 
I had the phone for a total of 7 months before I dropped it on 
the sidewalk and the phone wouldn't even turn on again. I understand that phones do 
break - they can't last forever. But this phone is so large that it's hard 
to keep a hold of it, and the first incident definitely shouldn't have caused permanent 
internal screen damage. This phone is extremely brittle. I wouldn't purchase this again.
