Product listed as in very good condition. Used phone arrived in reasonable appearance . Cheap 
non rim replacement battery. Had to replace with new battery within 2 weeks.My son informed 
me the volume control buttons non functional, a few prior txt msg's still on phone. 
Contacted seller to return but did not return as my son never gave it back 
to return. Let seller off the on the returnBUT to list as very good condition 
was misleading. Seller offered another phone at 50% off, no thank you.Pete
