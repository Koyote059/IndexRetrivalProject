I'm very happy with the purchase! The phone works perfectly, and as I expected. My 
one small complain is that the top part of the screen kinda edge out of 
its case, so I occasionally have to push it back in so it's snug. It 
doesn't come out but starts to edge out, which I'm guessing is because the screen 
was once replaced. I've replaced a screen in the past and the same thing would 
happen because some of the glue and snuggness of everything is lost when parts are 
changed. In any case, its not enough to bother me and I've got a good 
case for it, so I'm looking forward to lots of time with this phone. For 
the price it's excellent.
