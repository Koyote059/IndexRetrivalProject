These people need to state upfront, the fact that this phone has no US charger, 
no instructions in English, is based on the Orange network in Europe, so the additional 
extensive functions will only work for Orange users. These people are based in NYC, and 
I'm in California, so there's obviously an integrity issue here. I've seen other Americans say 
the same thing about other unlocked GSM world phones purchased from this company. I'm sure 
it's a great phone, but if I can't even charge it/comprehend the instructions if I 
could/ or use any of the additional dowload/update functions, what good is it?
