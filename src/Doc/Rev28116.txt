I am far from being an expert. I got this phone becuase my 4 year 
old Blackberry died and had to upgrade, thus new in Android and the phone. All 
works well except: Battery life is too short. I dont download videos or play games, 
regular use, but before 6 pm the battery is at 4 % after an all 
night charge.Second and last issue: Very weak WiFi signal. Within 10 feet to get half 
decent signal.All the rest work very well.
