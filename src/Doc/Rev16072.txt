This Nokia Lumia seems like it should be a really FANTASTIC smartphone. But it is 
not.I have a couple of minor issues and one major one. This phone cannot attach 
photos and cannot receive attachments. Seriously! The sound quality is terrible. Those are minor issues. 
Nokia has a TON of Lumia smartphones - that is a minor issue that I 
will come back toThe big issue - the big problem and the big negative of 
this phone is the user interface. It seems like it should do everything, but it 
does not. Microsoft wants windows to act the same way across all devices, and that 
SOUNDS like a great idea. It might work on a tablet or laptop or pc, 
or even a server. It does not work here. The interface gets in the way 
of taking photos. Photos end up dark, out of focus, color-mixed, and worthless. The interface 
gets in the way of making calls - hanging up, switching between calls without intervention 
and generally frustrating to no end. The interface gets in the way of sending texts 
- texts!?!?! Almost anything you might want to do with this high quality device will 
be a combination of "How in the world does MS want me to do this?"Cell 
providers are no help (I tried this phone with Tmobile and with AT&T). Why not? 
Well, it is a Nokia Lumia 920, but Nokia has a 1020, a 1520, a 
520, a 530, a 710, a 521, and about a thousand similar devices. Each of 
them must have their own unique quarks and quibbles, because on a combined basis, they 
are beyond the intelligence of the technical support of the cell provider.After paying about $500 
for this, it now sits on a shelf. It takes poor photos, makes poor calls, 
doesn't attach and frustrates. Life is too short to deal with junk like this. I've 
replaced it with a Samsung galaxy s4 - which at this point I'd give 4 
1/2 stars to.I do NOT recommend the Nokia Lumia 920 to anyone. For anything.
