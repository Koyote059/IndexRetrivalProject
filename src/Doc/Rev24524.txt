This is a great phone. My son dropped his phone in the swimming pool. An 
inexpensive option is to buy a prepaid ATT GoPhone like this one. Then take the 
SIM card out of the old phone and put it in the new phone once 
it is fully charged. If your SIM card is damaged, I am told that you 
can go to ATT store and ask for a replacement SIM card. It works great 
and this is actually a very good phone. Very lightweight, very good battery life. Keys 
are larger than most phones, so texting is easy to do. THis is not a 
smartphone, but a great phone for kids who need texting capabilities. I highly recommend this 
phone at around $30.00.
