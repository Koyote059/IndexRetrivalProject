Great phone. Fits nicely in hands. Slightly thicker than iphone but I think overall this 
has a very comfortable form factor. Using it on t-mobile without any issues. Battery life 
is good and camera is awesome. Not missing my Samsung phone that it replaced. Pity 
that no carrier is supporting Sony in the US.
