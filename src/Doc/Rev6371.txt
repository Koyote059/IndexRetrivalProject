I've had this phone for a year now and love it. Got T-Mobile for it 
and I use it every day. It's been through alot and still works like the 
day I got it, but with quite a few nicks, scratches, and even dents on 
the sides. Most of which were my friends fault for taking my phone and messing 
with it. I'd suggest getting a case for it. Just incase you have crazy friends 
that like to take your phone like me. The screen get's lots of finger prints 
and grease on it but what phone doesn't? If you get water or in many 
of my cases sweat on the screen it'll wack out or just stop working until 
it's cleaned and dried. Hasn't ever been a big problem for me but there could 
be times when you stuck in the rain, need to call for a ride, and 
the screen won't work because one too many droplets got on it. The camera and 
video camera are great, can take really good pictures and video aslong as you don't 
use zoom or shake it too much, the phone looks cool, has good sound, and 
has served me well. I payed 220 bucks for it and is worth every penny.
