At first I loved the phone. It seemed like a great deal. But within first 
few months, I've experienced multiple problems. The phone regularly jams/freezes and has to be restarted 
to work. Then the charging slot stopped working and I have to hold the cord 
the whole time for it to charge. And the charger doesn't work. Finally now the 
battery does not hold charge -- it can go from 50 percent to 1 percent 
in minutes. I am not sure whether it's just bad lunch with my device, but 
my phone has largely caused grief than happiness. And to top it off, Blu is 
not responding to emails sent to their customer service.
