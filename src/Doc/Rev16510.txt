Despite Motorola packaging being a little beat up, This appears to be a new phone. 
Connected perfectly with Page Plus wireless and now have 4g using the newly released Page 
Plus Sim card. Got this from Oliver's Amazing Deals through Amazon and am quite satisfied. 
Happy I didn't have the bad experience of many other reviews posted here.
