I got two of these phones to use overseas and it is definitely an international 
version and it was unlocked. The only thing is that one had "Claro" (which apparently 
is a telecommunications company) logo printed on the bottom quite large and noticeable. It doesn't 
really bother me, I am over it, but I am sure others would not care 
for it. I also find that the "Y" button tends to stick at times. Also 
the camera does not have a flash, so I was unhappy about that, it really 
doesn't take very good pictures. But it works in Indonesia where I am, so it 
suits the purpose. Also, the model is a few years old, so the accessories for 
it are limited and harder to find. Overall, an average phone.
