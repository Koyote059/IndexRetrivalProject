it said unlocked, that's fine and i got the signal bar on the top of 
the screen using my own simcard from my country operator.but when i tried to check 
my balance (using key *888#) it says "call failed"i didn't tried to make a call 
to any number because i'm currently on international roaming, but i only make an operator 
call and it was operator machine answered.
