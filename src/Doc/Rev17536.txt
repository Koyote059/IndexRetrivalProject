First i have to say.. been an iPhone user for so long (since iPhone 3G) 
and never been an android guy. I decided i had to change of brand but 
not spending the amount of money a xperia Z or and samsung S7 edge cost... 
i was pretty insecure about getting the moto g4plus or the huawei p9 lite... and 
after watching a bunch of youtube videos comparing both cellphones and review sites lite gsmarena 
and so... i decided to go with moto..Its been a month since i had my 
phone and I have to say i couldn't make a better decision.this phone its so 
light.. not that big (5.5 inch screen and im able to hold it with 1 
hand without trouble) screen is pretty bright and colours look great even at 1% dim.i 
got the 4gb ram and 64 gb of HD for a incredible $250 price at 
amazon. so my moto is pretty fast and can handle a lot of apps at 
the same time. (whatsapp, Facebook, instagram, mail, pokemon go, and 10 or more) without taking 
any considerable decrease of its speed or lag. Camera is Ok and the "professional" setup 
on the go is really cool. It can be better with the low light photos 
but its right considering what it cost.Battery life is the standard long lasting but having 
the Turbo charger for free is pretty great.The fingerprint square is something it could be 
made a little more functional and maybe like the huawei in the back. Or.. if 
its gonna be in the front of the cellphone, devs could have done a home 
button with it.. or the ON/OFF button or something like this.The only reason i don't 
give this phone a 5 stars its because of the sound. its somehow pretty low 
and thats ok for most people but i am sort of deaf so i really 
was looking for a really loud phone.Anyway.. great phone till now.. no complains but audio. 
No excessive heat. pretty fast and complete for $200
