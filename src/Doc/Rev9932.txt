Really like the phone love that it's 4glte. I didn't have a problem putting it 
on metro PCs service. The ui is pretty similar to samsungs ui so if you're 
a long time galaxy user like me you will feel right at home. The only 
thing that I hate is that your app drawer is always on screen there isn't 
a butting u press to get to it and I hate that.
