started out well, but after a while started malfunctioning ... and now today... it has 
managed to completely ruin my SD card.. it has erased everything on it and the 
on and off button does not even work that well. apps are freezing and receiving 
a phone call and typing a message are the hardest things to do on the 
phone... it only worked well for one month... it looks good but after the first 
month ... you feel like you wasted your money... and by that time... you cant 
even return it anymore.... several times, i wish i could bash it against the wall... 
i am not usually on my phone so when i use it to communicate, it 
is very important .. this was a wasted investment, i bought it for $100 more 
than it is worth right now, a dear waste.
