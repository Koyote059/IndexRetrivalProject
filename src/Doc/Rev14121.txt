Yes, this phone is very slick. I like the appearance of this phone a lot, 
but not so much the inside. No native Video Calls or Notes (very important). The 
camera wise is alright. I compared it with my old iPhone 5 and I think 
the iPhone won though. Photography is one of my hobbies and this phone is definitely 
not for me. I'm returning it. Too much limitations.
