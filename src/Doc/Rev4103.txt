I have had this phone since late 2014... and it was a great upgrade from 
my Samsung Galaxy S4. The reviews I read said it has the longest battery life 
of any phone that year [maybe even still to date??]. While many of the features 
seemed to be middling, such as the screen resolution and processor speed, they are not 
terribly noticeable to me -- even after 1.5yrs of usage. In fact, the screen resolution 
and brightness, the battery life, the processor speed, and everything else about this phone have 
made it a pleasure to use since its purchase.My requirements for a smartphone may not 
meet those of others, but I especially love: (1) the large screen, (2) the battery 
life; (3) the microSD card slot; (4) the great reception and number of supported telcom 
bands; (5) the wi-fi connectivity [it supports the 5Ghz band and 802.11ac]; (6) the availability 
and ease of installation of the Android v5.1 upgrade.So while it may not be the 
fastest phone available, nor the best at graphics... it definitely is the most usable Android 
phone that I have ever purchased and the one the I have kept and used 
the longest... and I do not have to charge it every night or even two... 
so much better than my last Samsung.
