First of all, I bought two Nokia L820 from Blutekusa (fulfillment by Amazon) as new 
factory unlocked 4G LTE penta bands: (800/900/1800/2100/2600 MHz), however I received 2 AT&T unlocked Lumia 
820 (Variant RM-824) which is a dual band LTE (1700/700 MHz) with no standard accessories 
(Nokia AC-50U MicroUSB Charger, Nokia Charging and Data Cable (CA-190CD)) or earphones. I received a 
no brand generic Chinese charger that it is not able to remain attached to the 
cell phone during charging because of the weakness of its attachment clips at the micro 
usb connector. Everybody knows that AT&T devices never come factory unlocked, they are exclusively manufactured 
for its network, so these Cells are not new they were refurbished to be unlocked. 
Moreover, I think that the back shell is not original because it arrived with a 
little dent in one of its corners and with no brand (Nokia/AT&T) or parte number 
it is completely flat (inside and outside) and is so weak that I damaged a 
corner with the nail trying to remove the shell to install the battery. I was 
able to update the OS to WP Amber and it works really fast.As you can 
see on previous reviews Nokia L820 is a really good cell phone (a little giant 
but not excellent) with fluent WP8 but with really two big sins: the 1650mAh Battery 
is too little for all things that you can do with this cell phone and 
the lacking of gorilla glass.
