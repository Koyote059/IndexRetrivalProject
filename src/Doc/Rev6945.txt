whats good? its the american version with the US warranty with no bloatware. the bad... 
its GSM only and doesnt work for verizon. got it for good price of $399 
witch cant be beat anywhere else for this phone(brand new). unfortunately i had to return 
it bc i have verizon or else the ratings would have been higher. (if I 
was ebay savvy i can probably sell it for more and make money. but then 
a new model might be out "the s7")
