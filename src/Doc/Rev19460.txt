I needed to replace my cellphone. My cellphone that I have had for 3 years 
wasn't a smart phone, just regular. I looked around and studied and found this was 
the best low priced unlocked smart phone. I can use it on WiFi to play 
games and browse. I use the cellphone strictly for calls and texts. I haven't tried 
it for texting, but I find it works wonderfully for calls. I had to re-learn 
how to make and receive calls, since this is the first time I have used 
a smart phone. I have an android tablet that I enjoy so I find this 
android smartphone to be handy to take with me if I want to browse on 
WiFi when I am away from home. I used to take the tablet and the 
cellphone with me when I went out. Now they are combined in one unit. This 
android cellphone/tablet is slow for a quad-core OS. I guess it is the .5 G 
of RAM that limits how fast it goes. I am satisfied with it however, and 
bring a lithium battery pack along to plug into the smartphone when the battery gets 
low and I want to play games or browse.
