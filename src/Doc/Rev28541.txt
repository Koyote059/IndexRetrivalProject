The phone arrived as promised. I really like this phone more than I thought I 
would. The blue plastic is glossy and smooth like glass to me. And not everyone 
has an iPhone like this so that is a plus. I am with T mobile. 
The phone came with a ATT sim car in it. I just switched it out 
and it was working right away. I speed says Tmobile LTE.The only downside I can 
see is the screen is not as big as the new Iphone6, as a phone 
I like this size more. Another thing I wonder is how much longer will Apple 
support the iPhone 5c. I had to upgrade from a flawless iPhone 4, because that 
is no longer supported. Which is fine, just that I need a certain app for 
work, and they only go back as far as the 4s. But I figure the 
price will make up for that, because by the time it is unsupported, I will 
be able to get the iPhone 6 at a discounted price. So will maybe come 
out to the same in the long run, but end up with two phones instead 
of one.
