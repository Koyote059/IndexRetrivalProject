I'm going to be honest I'm not going to give you this long 20 page 
review. I'm just going to say, it's not the best to get your phone here 
cause you have no plan or anything like that. My phone came in like brand 
new, except for the small problem. My phone would start turning off randomly after 2 
months of getting it. It wasn't that bad until a month later it got so 
bad I couldn't be on my phone for 3 minutes without it turning it off. 
A little after that it would turn on but stay on the apple then turn 
off. I couldn't be on my phone at all. I had to get it fixed 
for $60 not a lot , but this is when they raised the price and 
I had to pay $310 for my phone. I found out a piece inside my 
phone would heat up so bad it would turn my phone off. When they fixed 
it I had to restart my phone. I hope my review helped you guys out 
:)
