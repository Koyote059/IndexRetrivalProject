I'm in love with Samsung. I owed the S3 for a few years and upgraded 
to the S5. When I wanted to travel to Europe this year, I wanted to 
keep in touch with family back home. That required an unlocked, international phone. I saw 
this and for the price, I thought I would give it a shot.I took this 
to Spain last week and I must say that it works like a champ. I 
bought a 20 Euro data sim card at the vodafone store. I was able to 
facebook, upload pics, and use the gps all week long. I had no surprises, outages, 
or overages.I love the battery life and I love the display. This also doesn't have 
as much bloatware as the phones you get from the cell phone companies.Oh, I did 
buy a 128 GB memory card as well. That was my only addition to this 
phone.This phone and me, we are going to see the world together.
