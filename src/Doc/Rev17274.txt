It "looked" new, as it was in a box packaged in cellophane, but on close 
inspection, it's clearly a refurbished phone. It had a few light nicks and scratches, nothing 
I was really worried about, but the camera totally sucked. No matter what trick I 
tried (I've read all the message boards), the camera on this phone simply will not 
focus. Overall, I don't recommend purchasing this item. Just go to an Apple store and 
get the iPhone S. Yes, it will cost you about $150 more, but it's well 
worth the extra money. I ended up doing that after having this phone for only 
2 months. The camera feature is too important to me. Plus, if you purchase a 
new phone, you'll have the warranty and protection. Buying this particular phone from this particular 
company is very risky.
