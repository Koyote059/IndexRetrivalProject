Well, a little confusing at first. I was upgrading from my old Samsung Galaxy Ace 
prototype I got SEVERAL years ago. After I finally got through the initial set up 
programing it is great so far....just got it yesterday. Very nice size and now that 
I have gotten into it a little, it seems super easy to use. Has all 
the old features I used all the time on my old phone. Would recommend HIGHLY!!
