I like BLU. I own a Studio Energy 2, and an R1 HD (16 gig). 
My stepdaughter wanted a 6 " phablet so I surprised her with this Studio 7.0 
LTE. It was impressive until it bricked after about 1 month of heavy use. I 
expect that my refund will not be a problem and I'll be buying her an 
R1 HD, and saving the other $50. I honestly expected something like this, and I'm 
not overly disappointed. I've had worse overall satisfaction with Apple,Samsung, AT& T and the contract 
cell industry in general- BLU makes so many great devices for us budget minded folks,can 
forgive this one misstep. One!ð
