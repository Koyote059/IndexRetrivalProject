I really wanted this phone to work out for my mother. I really bought into 
the meaning of the name- BOLD LIKE US and wanted to get off the high 
priced phone/contract extension roller coaster.. She still has the Iphone 3 and I thought for 
sure this would be and upgrade. Unfortunately, It was a hard switch for her, as 
far as being able to convert to the new operation system (my mom is a 
fast learner under 50years young and a professional). The Screen is way too large to 
be called a mini. So big that you pretty much need to use both hands 
to everything except hold it to talk. We have decided to return the phone because 
the sound quality was not very good. Yes, you can hear well when using the 
phone but when my mom called me, her voice sounded muffled and that was one 
issue too many... One more thing- the picture quality was not that great. I'd give 
it a C grade. Still, I do recommend this phone for anyone that needs a 
cheap phone (teens) likes to surf on the web.
