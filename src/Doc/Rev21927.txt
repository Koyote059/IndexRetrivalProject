I'm not a smart phone consumer, yet. This phone is a great value for the 
price, but it is very unfriendly to the user. The keys are too close together, 
which causes mis-dialing. The manual included with the phone is no good in finding information. 
The phone doesn't alert you when you have a missed call. You have to go 
through too many steps to find missed calls. Make sure you order a data plug, 
because it doesn't come with one. The camera is a little weak. I haven't got 
too many clear pictures. I thought maybe I am doing something wrong, but the manual 
doesn't address troubleshooting the camera. I can't find the zoom. I'm lost. That's why I 
am giving it only stars for the value according to the price.
