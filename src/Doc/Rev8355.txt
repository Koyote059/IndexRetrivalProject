I hate being lied to! I bought this particular item because it is being sold 
as the original Otterbox brand. Note the picture showing the item in authentic Otterbox packaging. 
Zoom in on the picture and you can read "Made in Mexico". I don't imply 
there's an advantage to a thing being made in Mexico; only that is where the 
original was made, so it looks authentic. This item arrived in a clear cellophane wrapper 
with nothing printed on it. It does not say "Made in Mexico" or "Made in 
Mars", for that matter. Perhaps it was made on somebody's home 3-D printer.If the seller 
had been good enough to admit this is a counterfeit product but claim the quality 
is as good as the original, I might not be angry. In fact, it looks 
like it's constructed of the same material. It fits tight and swivels as it ought 
to do. I do not complain about its apparent quality. I complain because the seller 
is a liar.
