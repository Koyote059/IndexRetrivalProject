The one star is not for the phone, it's for the fact that I received 
a used/refurbished/broken phone. I've used 3 different generations of LG phones with no problems. I 
was unable to get access to the network and returned it for the MOTO G4, 
which works very well. Hated giving up the LG, but didn't want to take a 
chance on another unlocked LG with the same problem.
