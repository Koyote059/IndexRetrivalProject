This phone was okay upon receiving it. It has not been a year, however, and 
even with treating my device delicately, the electronics have started to fail. I cannot speak 
into the phone unless I utilise the speaker function, it does not recognise some types 
of headphones, and also, the bluetooth function is finicky and highly selective. The worst part 
about this device, is that it is nigh impossible to get in contact with Posh 
Mobile to express your problems.
