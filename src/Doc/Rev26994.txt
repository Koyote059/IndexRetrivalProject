I absolutely love this phone. For one thing it is huge, no squinting at this 
screen. But to be honest I wasn't really looking for this phone when I came 
across it. But when I seen how much it was and the fact that it 
actually IS a phone I was thrilled. I was looking for a tablet that was 
unlocked so that I could get internet with out wi-fi, so I was and am 
still thrilled. I got a sim card from my phone company (NOT one of the 
LIFE draining Pay for every last bit of data, phone companies) wich is cool because 
when I run out of 4G it just drops to 3G No biggy. Yes the 
camera isn't the best and the speaker is less than to be desired, how ever, 
having said that the phone is awesome, it looks really good and so does the 
screen it, the phone isn't very slow and it has 32 Gigs on board with 
an SD card slot to expand even that. My first smart phone cost twice as 
much as this one and only had 8 Gigs. This phone is worth every penny.
