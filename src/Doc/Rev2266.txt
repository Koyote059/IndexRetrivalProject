Love using the Lumia 950 XL as my daily driver, a lot of great screen 
real estate. Great battery life. Having been a Windows Mobile user for years (Lumia 920 
from launch, and Lumia 1520) I'm used to the app gap, however it has been 
closing for most important apps more recently. With the introduction of Redstone 1 build in 
August 2016, there is a lot more stability and function. Hopefully we'll continue to see 
more improvements the Redstone 2 and a larger market share which will in turn promote 
app development for the Windows platform.
