I was waiting for a good phone for my dad and this was it. It 
was having all the features that was needed on a smart phone. 16 GB in 
built and expandable slot up to 64 GB makes this phone a better one. Ample 
storage space. Nice Camera.. Not a great camera like a galexy or iphone.. Cannot even 
compare with other smart phones. But once a picture is clicked, the quality is not 
bad at all. Little slow on focus etc. Well, how much can u expect on 
a 135$ phone. But, I think they have given everything on this. Gr8 battery life. 
The best part I liked on this product is, everything comes in the box. Cover, 
screen protector, etc. Nothing to buy separately. Color is gr8. The only thing as a 
drawback is the camera, which I am not sure how much would be needed. However, 
I have not tested on the signals yet. I will have to check it and 
will provide my feedback on this again. For now, certainly a 5 start for this.. 
Love it..
