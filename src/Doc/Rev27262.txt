I was looking for an inexpensive phone to use as a dedicated Sonos controller so 
I probably should not be the first to review this phone. I have gotten by 
for years with an iPod Touch and an old flip phone and so I am 
not really familiar with smart phones. But to this novice it has an impressive screen; 
colors just seem to leap out at you. Seems to have a sturdy build, feels 
like metal to me. I was surprised at how big it is compared to my 
iPod. It is also at least two times as heavy, which is not an issue 
to me for now as I am using it at home as a Sonos controller. 
But someday I may decide to use it as a phone and the weight may 
be an issue then. It has a large battery, which may explain the weight. I 
charged it 4 days ago and it still has 85% of its power left (but 
again I am not using it as a phone yet).I did have a problem getting 
it to read a 64 gb microSD card; but, Blu's support helped me find the 
problem (card came as exFAT instead as FAT 32 & once I formatted it to 
FAT 32 it worked).One more note. I did not realize there are 2 versions of 
this phone, one with World GSM & one with US GSM. Reading the description on 
Amazon it said something about being able to use internationally & with my lack of 
knowledge I thought maybe I could use it when I go to Italy. The US 
one will work in most areas of the Western Hemisphere but not in Europe. The 
World GSM model is not available yet on Amazon (as of 3/17/2017).
