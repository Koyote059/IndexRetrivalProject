I purchased this phone hoping to replace one that I broke. I was able to 
activate this without a hitch, however there was no card in the phone so I 
was unable to take pictures with it. It also didn't work about 1/2 the time. 
I did use this phone for about 6 months before I gave in and got 
a different one.
