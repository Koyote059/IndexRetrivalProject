I was so skeptical about ordering a cell phone from amazon only bc of the 
reviews saying the phones were not new, certain parts of the phones didn't work, etc. 
I took that chance bc I was in dying need of a phone and didn't 
want to pay 500 plus dollars for a phone. The phone was packaged nicely, new 
earpiece, the phone appeared to be brand new, etc. . The ONLY reason I didnt 
give it a 5 stars is bc of the volume. The people on the other 
end can't hear me well unless the phone is on speakerphone or I have the 
earpiece in. If the sender could fix this problem, that would be great. But Not 
one to complain but It's pretty annoying. Besides the volume, I definitely would recommend. Thanks 
:)
