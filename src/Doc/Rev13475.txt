When I decided to buy a new phone, was just because my "old" 5c iPhone, 
was with many problems and to fix this in Brasil has a high cost. So, 
I searched a device which had a designer similar to iPhone but low cost. So, 
I found the Blu Company, and I simply loved the idea of this company, and 
I found Vivo 5! The design, the functions and the usability.But,if you are looking for 
a terrific camera, I can tell you, with this cellphone you will be a honesty 
and good camera during the day and a not so good camera at night. I 
had doubts as to use Android and size (I always had smaller devices), but, two 
days using the phone, I forgot that! So, if you want a device with designer, 
usability, duration of battery, and a lot of resources, this is the phone.
