Got it from brotherhood services as a Verizon unlocked refurbished phone.Came with some annoying Verizon 
apps which is to be expected. Thankfully you can make them disappear (hide) though I 
don't think you can uninstall them.As described, there were minor scratches on the back, which 
is fine by me as I use a cover anyway. The charging port had some 
scratching and decoloration on it (which is to be expected) The most important part: the 
screen was unscratched.Phone is fast and feels entirely new.My only complaint is that the package 
did not come with a release "pin" or "needle" to remove the sim card and 
micro SD card tray. I had to use a mechanical pencil very carefully as the 
release button is in a hole which is extremely small.
