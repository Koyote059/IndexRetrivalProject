Honestly. I don't know HOW THESE AREN'T MORE EXPENSIVE. The Turbo 2 has the same 
performance as my old Galaxy 6. For who ever designed the new Galaxies they should 
be fired. Honestly. Droid obviously chose practicality over feel. The Samsung covered their phone in 
Glass. And what is the first thing that breaks on a phone? the Glass. So 
the Droid Turbo 2 is for the normal human that doesn't have to cover the 
phone in expensive cases. The droid turbo is fast. Well designed. And a proper phone. 
I've had galaxies, I've owned an iPhone. And I owned the old Turbo. Motorola all 
the way because they aren't made to break and aren't a silly fashion statement. The 
reviewers that give this phone criticism about how it looks should go outside and see 
how it fairs in normal conditions of day to day use. The droid turbo 2 
is only proper phone that I have owned that has earned its dollar. If you 
want a phone that works, isn't covered in thin glass. Then buy it. If you 
want a fashion statement. Go buy something else. I've owned the Casio Commando. They have 
the similar thought but never had the performance. This cuts it close. IF you want 
it waterproof. Grab a life proof case. I would buy this 10 times over any 
new galaxy or iPhone. I bought it used. It came in amazing shape. It's a 
brand new phone. I can't tell the difference.Pros: Not made of glass, made to survive 
the day to day. Great performance. Battery superb. Amazing Price over the Samsungs or Apple 
Phones. Properly made.Con's: Not waterproof but honestly what phone with this sort of performance is?Not 
a fashion statement.
