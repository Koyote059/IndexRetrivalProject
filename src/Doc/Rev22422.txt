MISLEADING. There is NO DISCLAIMER that this phone has to be unlocked using AN AMERICAN 
SIM CARD before you can switch to an international carrier. The device description says that 
it will work with ALL GSM carriers; however, when you get the device there is 
a warning inside the box that the device must be used for a total of 
five minutes with an American sim card before it can be fully unlocked. THIS IS 
NOT STATED ON AMAZON.VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON'S LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.
