So I bought this phone because I smashed my BLU Studio 6.0 beyond repair. This 
is a 3G+HSPA phone and it outperforms the Galaxy Note II I also smashed. This 
is what I do. I am where smartphones come to die a catastrophic death. I 
would rather smash $125 phones than $700 phones, even with insurance. But here's the best 
part. Maybe it's the Samsung and carrier bloatware, but even this 3G phone is faster 
and the battery life is better than the expensive ones. I am a BLU fan 
for sure. Make sure you check all the features and buy the one you need. 
But these guys make a good product. You will need to download an app to 
raise the volume on your sounds and music, but that's no big deal.
