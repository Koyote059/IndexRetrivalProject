I bought a used one for 200 last year, it lasted a year until I 
hurled it repeatedly into the wall last week. Now I am buying another 1. I 
had a simple hard rubber case and screen protectors that helped it remain in mint 
condition, though being dropped constantly. Despite the camera flash only working sporadically after the phone 
updated itself, it is very reliable has excellent cameras Great HD. I recomend turning the 
phone off once a day. It can keep tons of apps running in the background 
and still stream HD vids and take calls without an act of congress. Everything runs 
the way people with I-phones wish their phones would work. ***Also Tmobile has *4 gigs 
of *4g speed with *no contract and *unlimited texts for * $30.00 a month and 
has download speeds of 8mb per second on average. Don't be a sucker. Since the 
plan only has 100 anytime minutes it may be necessary to get a simple unlimited 
talk phone for 20 a month, essentially having 2 phones with unlimited everything for 50 
per month with no tax. LOL. And but the best 4G internet there is (Having 
tried Sprints "Unlimited Data where they throtlle the hell out of your ass and knowing 
the evil ways of Verizon, I try not to reward there scumbaggedry). Or you could 
be moocher and get an Obama Phone to compliment your Smart Phone that you bought 
with your welfare $. :(
