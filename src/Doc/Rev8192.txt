I bought this refurbished phone because mine was old and wouldn't hold a charge for 
more than a 4-5 hours and I didn't want to spend a ridiculous amount of 
money on a brand new phone. I was skeptical after reading some reviews, but the 
refurbished phone works great! No visible damages, either. The only problem is that it didn't 
come with a sim card. I called my carrier to have one shipped, but they 
needed some number that was not included with the phone so I had to go 
into the local store to have a sim card installed.
