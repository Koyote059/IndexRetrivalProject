I bought this phone right before christmas and over all the phone works really good. 
But the post is misleading because it says this is a new phone. This phone 
is not new, it is referbished and the reason why i am upset isnt because 
it is refurbished. I am upset because a refurbished evo 4g is $100 cheaper then 
this phone is. I paid 280 thinking this was a new phone and another seller 
was selling "refurbished evo 4g's" for 160!!!!! I am very upset because of this. Another 
thing is that the battery was bad. They sent me a bad used battery. Luckily 
i have insurance and sprint gave me a new battery for free, which would have 
been 40 if they didnt replace it for me, but i am very upset with 
this company. I love the phone but the company is HORRIBLE!UPDATE!!!!--If i may also add 
this phone is defective. about 3 months into using this phone the charger port got 
lose so i brought it to sprint thinking they could fix it and they couldnt. 
it disconnected completely from the chip?? I dont remember the exact verbage of what was 
wrong. so i had to pay another 100 as a deductible to sprint for them 
to send me another phone. This is the most misleading company i have ever ordered 
from. i will NEVER buy another phone from amazon EVER AGAIN!!! Id rather get what 
i pay for instead of spending over 400 all together just to get a new 
phone. Very dissapointed and upset.
