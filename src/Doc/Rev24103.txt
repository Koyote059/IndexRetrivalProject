The phone seems to have really great features. Light, dual sim and great size. Just 
as I was getting the hang of it, it slipped my hand and fell to 
the ground. The screen shattered. I did not even get the opportunity to put on 
the case. I had a blackberry before. It fell about 100 times over the 2 
years I've owned it. It still works today.I gave this phone a two star rating 
due to its lack of durability.
