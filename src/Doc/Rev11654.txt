It's been 7 months since I got it and it's been nothing but trouble. First 
the update center is not available in this phone, so I am stuck with the 
software version it came with and although the has been a new one for quite 
some time now it does not give me the option to upgrade it.Battery life started 
to decrease after the first 4 months. I checked the battery and it was about 
to pop out so I blamed the battery and got a new one before the 
original one would blow up on me. With the new battery in place I am 
having even worse battery life and the phone is overheating. I know this is probably 
an issue with this phone because I had bought another one just like it but 
from a different vendor, which has been working great for over 1.5 years now.
