This phone works great. The battery life is amazing and the ringer volume can be 
set quite loud so I never miss a call. I also use it as a 
mp3 player and it is great as I have a 1gb memory stick micro in 
it with all of my favorite songs. The camera is good too. The slider feels 
sturdy. The green and black give the phone a unique look as well. It is 
also smaller than what I thought it would be. It is the same size as 
the w580. But this one is better in my opinion when it comes to looks 
and the placement of the buttons.
