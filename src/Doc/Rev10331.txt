What a disaster. It is impossible to get the back cover off to put in 
the sim. Even the guy at Sears couldn't get it off! I went to the 
website and they had a worthless cartoon for help. I found a YouTube that had 
a person, but was unable to get the backcover off, even trying to copy the 
actions on YouTube. Do NOT buy this phone, or anything from Motorola, unless you are 
in a physical store where you can make sure it is working before you walk 
out the door. Now I have to try to return this to Amazon and have 
little hope of that working either.
