I purchased two LG KP500 phones from [...] through Amazon.com. The phones are great as 
I expected. However, the travel charger is useless in US because they are for 220V 
international type of adapter. I cannot use them at home in US. The package came 
with an additional international plug adapter but it does not fit the LG charger adapter. 
I tried to call [...] but cannot find the correct place to call since the 
packing list does not have a custmer service phone number. I am now stuck with 
this useless adapter. Luckly, I have an old LG phone and I am using the 
old charger.I am not sure there is a way to identify these details when we 
order the product since Amazon.com specifically note that there is no warranty for this product. 
I wish Amazon.com can take the responsibility.
