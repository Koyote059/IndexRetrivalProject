The descriptions states: RM-820 4G Network LTE 800 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 
2600. It DOES NOT WORK ON 2600!!! I travel a LOT for business and bought 
this phone to be able to contact clients and keep updated on emails and whatsapp. 
I travel to Brazil frequently and it DOES NOT WORK ON LOCAL 4G networks. I 
tried to update it and be able to set maximum speed to 3G (which shoukd 
work) but it does not allow me this option (blocked by ATT). FRUSTRATING as it 
states a 4G 2600 network and does not allow the user to set max speed 
to 3G (tha would work). RESULT: cannot use it in BRAZIL and other countries!!! wasted 
money...can anyone help??? MERCHANT: can you offer me a solution??? PLEAAASEEEE!!!! Otherwise, I love the 
phone!!
