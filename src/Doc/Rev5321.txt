Omg...this phone is the bomb...first I must say, it's worth your buy. I bought it 
for international use in the Caribbean, it will take some getting use too, since I 
was a blackberry bold girl...but I'm tired of walking around with 2 phones so or 
got this one...true to size...love the specs and I get all the service on it. 
My my.. Seller was great shipping on time as promise. Came brand new, unopened with 
seal still intact, wish the seller has send a case, or sold cases. Because I 
bought a case and still haven't gotten it as yet so I had to buy 
another one to protect the phone. Over all the phone is a great phone works 
wonderful. It is definitely a smart phone.Joyce
