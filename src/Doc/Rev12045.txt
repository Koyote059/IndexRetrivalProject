My 3 days with the Lumia 920 ended when the phone bricked. Nothing could get 
it to turn on.The worst thing though, was that this is not an international phone 
but rather a ATT branded phone that is unlocked. ATT is everywhere on this phone 
and that is not what I was looking for in a phone. My T-Mobile sim 
would work but MMS would not. I had to get a T-Mobile rep on the 
phone and spent a good hour trying to get it to work. Never did work 
completely.Sent back. (Did not send back yet).Update: I did manage to turn the phone back 
on after doing a hard reset. The next day it did the same thing. I 
have now installed the newest update and will keep the phone going until I can 
see if that fixes the resetting problem. I also got the MMS working after getting 
more help from T-Mobile. I will keep updating as I see how the phone now 
performs. The ATT branding still bothers me.Update 2: I did end up sending the phone 
back after it froze up again after the update. I did really like this phone 
and may try another one in case this one was just a lemon. I did 
like the fact that I could use internet sharing and T-Mobile didn't try to stop 
it. The camera was nice (I have a Nokia 808 so it still wasn't that 
impressive). I would have keep the phone but for the resetting problem.
