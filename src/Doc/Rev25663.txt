I just got the phone today so it may be a little too soon to 
post a review. However, it didn't take me long to fall in love with the 
camera and video quality and settings. They are most impressive. What is not impressive is 
the ridiculous amount of At&t bloatware. The seller advertised this phone as an UNLOCKED phone, 
not an At&t unlocked phone. There is a difference. I will update my review in 
a few months to let you know if the bloatware affects the functionality at all. 
If it does not, then I will give it the full 5 stars.
