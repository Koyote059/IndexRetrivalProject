they sold me a phone claimed it was NEW and it wasn't new it was 
activated in Jan 2015, I purchased it in August 2015 the phone has had a 
hardware malfunction and when I called apple support this is how I learned my phone 
was out of warranty because it had been activated in Jan so that is the 
date apple has on file>>>>>BUY BEWARE!!!!!
