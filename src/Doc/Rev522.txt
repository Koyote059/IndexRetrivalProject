Purchased this phone for my father, who is anti-smart phone. Set it up for him, 
and while doing so, observed the overall ruggedness of this phone. It's built like a 
brick $#@* house. I would say nearly indestructible. Menus are pretty much like any other 
flip phone, with maybe a better layout than most flip phones, but straight forward and 
easy to work with. As far as the battery, it lasts for a very long 
time on a single charge(unlike today's smart phones). He is more than pleased with it, 
and he and I both would suggest it to anyone who is in the market 
for a flip phone. Only down side I can think of is that it is 
thicker than other flip phones, but not too much so, and it feels nice and 
sturdy in your hand. Good design, water resistant, long battery life, and near unbreakable. If 
you're in the market for a flip phone, you can't go wrong with this one.
