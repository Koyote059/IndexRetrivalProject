I bought this phone because I loved my enV2 (until my sister broke it). I 
wanted another one and this one arrived looking great! But then the issues started. I 
had my phone on for no more that 1 hour (no dropping or anything) and 
it would just randomly shut off. When I turned it back on, it had full 
battery, then would turn off again in another hour. It was a pain and so 
not worth the money I paid for it!
