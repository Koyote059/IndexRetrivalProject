Be warned... There is no warranty on at least some of these phones. HTC claims 
my phone was purchased almost a year before I actually purchased it, and HTC wants 
an original receipt that includes the IMEI and Serial Numbers, none of which are provided 
with purchase, so even though the phone was technically OEM "new", it is apparently being 
re-sold as a new phone. I will change this review to 5 stars if HTC/seller 
resolves this issue, since the phone, when working, is quite good, but the warranty problems 
are a deal breaker.
