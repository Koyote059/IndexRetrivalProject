I say almost awesome for my title because of one big issue. The phone even 
with a 1Ghz processor becomes sluggish when too many apps are used or even one 
app like the GrooVeIP or GPS or streaming music for an extended period of time 
anywhere from 30 to 40 minutes on wards. My wife's Samsung Transform Ultra from Boost 
mobile with just 800Mhz processor does not do it for similar functions. But the issue 
is fixed after a reboot. Other than this its an excellent phone especially for someone 
who does not use all the above mentioned apps or uses them casually its an 
excellent phone. That is the only reason I give 4 stars. I do not get 
4G for T-mobile where I live but it works great on my WiFy.
