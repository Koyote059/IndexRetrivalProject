Just like the title of this review states; this company sent me a phone with 
a disconnected service activation number so I wasn't even able to activate it. After contacting 
Verizon support and doing a bunch of trouble shooting the conclusion was met that the 
internal software of the phone had been reconfigured to call a different activation number other 
than Verizon's (i.e. Rooted/Jailbroken). I left numerous voicemails on the seller's helpline and never received 
a return call let alone actually ever talk to a person when I called. I 
honestly believe this company sends out defective phones in an attempt to get you to 
keep it till the 30 day return policy expires on it. Check the reviews on 
this phone, half are 1-2 stars and the other are 4-5. I think there's some 
shilling going on with this vendor...
