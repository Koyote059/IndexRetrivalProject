Blu Studio Super c phn received in good pkage.Very Nice but it failed to accept 
the 64GB Memory card I ordered with it as also my own 64GB. What could 
be wrong? I use it with my WiFi for fb etc because I didn't insert 
my Sim Card as I intend to send the phone phn to Nigeria,Could that be 
the reason for the Memory Cards Invalid?
