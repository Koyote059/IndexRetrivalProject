Amazon advertises this phone as a 4G, but it is not... It is only a 
3G capable device. So, if you are looking for a faster internet device, go with 
the C5503. I have not received mine yet, as I just ordered it yesterday. I 
had done research on the phone, and missed the facts about the 5502 being 3G 
and the 5503 being 4G until after I ordered it. As soon as I realized 
the diffference, I immediatly tried to cancel my order with Amazon, but of course it 
was too late.
