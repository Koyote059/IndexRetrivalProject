Had the phone for over 2 years now, there's been things that's changed my initial 
opinion. The phone is ok, it's not that great, at least into today's standard. The 
screen is too small, I always get complaints on how I can see this whenever 
I lend my friend to use it momentarily. The iOS has been supporting the iPhone 
quite sluggishly, it's not as snappy as it was the first day I purchased it. 
In every update it gets worse, at least after iOS 9. The camera is quite 
ok, it's fine for my use since I am not all that interested in taking 
pictures. Despite the horrible software it's been having recently, it's quite good. It's not as 
bad as the iPhone 4, it just works. What I most appreciate about this phone 
is the design, it's the last Apple iPhone device to have chamfered edges which I 
would miss if I upgraded. The camera doesn't protrude like the larger counterparts, it's design 
it's quite flawless. I would buy this phone currently again even though it's almost 3 
years old. It's good phone though, hence today's standard, I view it as a basic 
phone with limited use due to hardware limit, and software caps.
