When they first came out, the Droid-4 was exactly what I and many others needed 
with a slide out keyboard. It was perfect for those of us who can't stand 
typing on screens. But sadly, as apps continue to be developed this phone and operating 
system gets more and more obsolete, not able to run many of the modern day 
apps anymore. Facebook and facebook messenger, for starters. Frequent freeze-ups on the apps, or phone 
goes unresponsive. I thought it was just my phone at first, so I got another 
one. Same thing. So I went without some of those apps for awhile, until my 
job required me to use an app that the Droid 4 could not run because 
of all the freeze-ups. And because this has been the last smartphone designed with an 
external keyboard, I had no luck but to go to one of those blasted on-screen 
keyboards to which it is very frustrating to type on. But such is life. Out 
with the old, in with the new. She got 5 stars when she was released 
back in 2012, but how quickly time has passed.
