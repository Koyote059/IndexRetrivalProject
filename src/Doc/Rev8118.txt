i got this phone just for temporary use at least until the new phones are 
out in markets, to be honest didn't expect much with that price .but it turned 
out to be just as VERY good i like .screen not very fancy though when 
you put it in full brightness colors aren't so good . and i have one 
pixel out every time i put the phone on front camera mode on. but generally 
this phone hold up to my heavy hard core phone using lots of apps games 
and still no lag ., delivery on time and no problems what so ever with 
the dealer .
