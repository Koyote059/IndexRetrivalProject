We have had this item 33days. Ordered three of them.They seemed fine at first but 
last couple of weeks have had the following issues; battery's drain within 6-7hours with no 
talking or texting, can't set speed dial on any of them. Shuts off during conversation 
and start dialing another number, will Automatically dial 911 laying on table no one around, 
this has happened multiple times on all three phones, and in small town's dispatchers get 
grumpy with the unwanted calls, even with apologies.. Pictures can't be sent out to anyone. 
Took phone to AT&T store for help as no owners manuals came with the phones 
and was told internal build issues of the phone. I don't like to give bad 
reviews to anyone about anything but want to help people when necessary. Unfortunately can't send 
back now , JUST missed the 30 day return window. If I could give a 
zero rating I would. Sorry to say.. Hope they can improve their phones because they 
are a great price, nice size and good graphics, but that's it. Issue's listed have 
been and continue to be issue's on all three phones.
