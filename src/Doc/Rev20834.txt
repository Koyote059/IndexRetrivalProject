I got this phone in hopes that it would be a lot better than my 
last one and it has been nothing but crappy for me since I got it 
last month. It was really good at first but after about two weeks it started 
messing up.The phone would keep telling me that google has stopped and something about the 
HTC setup has stopped working and it asked me if I wanted to report it 
but once I clicked to tell HTC it would tell me that that has stopped 
as well.Maybe its just this one phone, but I don't recommend it to anyone.
