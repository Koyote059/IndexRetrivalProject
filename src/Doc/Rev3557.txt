I Ordered this phone 4 days ago and it came fast. But the phone was 
super nice and clean everything has been working perfectly so far. The only damage I 
could even notice was a little wear around the sim ejection hole but flawless otherwise. 
I'm an At&T user so I'm not sure if mine is locked to it or 
not but I'm so happy that I actually got everything I asked for at such 
a low price. Godbless
