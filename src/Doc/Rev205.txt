DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!Big buttons! Great! But the navigation ring around the enter button was 
a nightmare to use. It kept turning on the radio and good luck with turning 
the damn thing off. The task bar was ridiculous for a senior to try to 
use. The icons are framed with a tiny,tiny little blue outline which is impossible to 
see unless you are looking at it though a magnifying glass. Also, there are two 
slots for sim cards. If you only fill one, the "insert sim card" wording still 
stays on the screen which is a distraction. Sound quality was good but the navigation 
around this phone is bad thing that just kills what could have been a great 
little phone. In addition, tell me what good big buttons on the phone is good 
for when the instructions (what there are of them) are printed in size 4 font. 
What Senior citizen could read them? Worst phone I have ever bought and I am 
returning it immediately.
