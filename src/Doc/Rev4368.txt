UPDATE!! THIS PHONE IS SUPPOSED TO BE UNBREAKABLE THAT'S A COMPLETE LIE! I DROPPED MY 
PHONE FROM LESS THAN 3 FEET IT COMPLETELY SHATTERED THE FACE OF MY PHONE LOOKS 
LIKE I BEAT IT WITH A HAMMER! I CALLED BLU THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD 
COST $100 TO FIX a PHONE I PAID $200 AND IS NOW WORTH $149.I have 
it on metro network. I love how sleek it is. It came with an emoji 
keyboard already installed. The camera is great. It's a simple Android phone. I kinda wish 
it had a lil more but Overall it's great 5stars for my $200
