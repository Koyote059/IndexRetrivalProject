Extremely slow and unresponsive on Lollipop. I'm also constantly running into space issues, even with 
a SD card. Coming from a Lumia 635 (low budget windows phone with basically the 
same hardware), I have to say Windows Phone runs significantly better on low end hardware-- 
with the obvious drawback of very few third party apps. If you just want basic 
apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, FitBit, MyFitnessPal etc...) you're better off with a Windows phone. If 
you really need ALL the apps (Snapchat, Clash of Clans, Mobile Check deposit apps) either 
get an iPhone 5s or shell out for an Android phone with better hardware.
