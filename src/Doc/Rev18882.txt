I was happy I found this replacement phone on Amazon. The phone worked fine but 
after about two weeks of use it turned off by itself and would turn off 
while I'll was texting. It also started to pause way to long in response to 
a pressed key. Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I was able to return it for 
a refund. Not sure if these phones were new or refurbished. Oh well. I'm still 
searching for a good replacement because Verizon seems to be putting out crappy new phones 
for text and voice inorder to push us into a smart phone. No thanks Verizon!
