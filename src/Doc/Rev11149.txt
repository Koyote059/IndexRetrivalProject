The 6 plus and even the 6 are way too big, so I scrambled to 
get a 5s (refurbished) while I still could. (Of course, now they've introduced the SE, 
which might be better for you). It works with the latest iOS just peachy. Love 
it. I think ultimately Apple products are mostly over-priced, but the user experience is significantly 
better than competing products.Took me a long while to actually get on board with smart 
phones, this was an excellent entry into that world.
