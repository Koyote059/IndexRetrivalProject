Received on time and in good physical condition. Unpacked and charged battery to full and 
then inserted sim card and sd card. Booted and entered log in information and set 
up. Worked fine for about 4 hours and then screen went black. Could not restart 
bacause screen was black. Removed battery, waited about 30 seconds and put back in. Rebooted 
and heard sounds, but nothing on screen. Took out battery again and rebooted about 3 
different times. Could hear sounds but nothing on screen. Took out battery and rebooted once 
more and screen finally came on. Worked fine for about a day and then did 
same thing. Decided to return as defective. Not sure if I am going to try 
to purchase another "good as new" again.
