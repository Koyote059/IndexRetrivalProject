I got this for my aunt who just moved to the country.It is a good 
phone for the price and has some decent specs.Although the internal storage is a bit 
limiting with only 8 GB, its not really a big issue if you have an 
SD card.I would recommend this phone for anyone who is looking for something cheap to 
use and a temporary phone or maybe going to a different country.
