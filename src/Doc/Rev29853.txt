Very thin (far thinner than any iPhone or other Androids I've seen). Also very light, 
almost half as heavy as similarly sized smartphones without feeling cheap or flimsy.Screen has vivid 
colors and is like staring into the sun on full brightness (it's ridiculously bright, which 
is great for outdoor use; I keep the brightness slighter at maybe 30% and it's 
as bright as any of my old smartphones on max).Good audio quality - can hear 
others clearly with ample volume, no one has yet complained I'm hard to hear.Snappy and 
responsive opening apps, browsing, etc. Only bug with this android version I've experienced is camera 
app crashing when scrolling to bottom of options menu, otherwise very solid. Doesn't come with 
too many pre-loaded apps that need deleting (some can't be deleted, but can be disabled).Very 
good wifi strength, picks up signal from router in parts of home where other phones 
conked out.Battery life seems to be impressive so far -- after a full day's use 
will still have in the 40% range left.Only downsides:No microSD (guessing due to size limitation, 
but 16gb leaves almost 10gb available beyond OS and stock apps it ships with that 
cannot uninstalled.Plastic case phone ships with is chintzy - doesn't offer much protection if dropped, 
makes phone uncomfortable to hold since it has a sharp edge that runs along the 
bottom that will cut into your pinky if you rest the phone on it when 
talking. Wouldn't be an issue but there aren't any cases for this version yet (camera 
and speaker layout were changed, so can't use old Air case). Would prefer if shipped 
with a silicon/rubber case like the other two Blu phones we've bought.Conclusion - very happy 
with this phone. Would buy again and have already recommended to several friends.
