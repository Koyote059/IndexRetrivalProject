I just got this recently and let me just say, for someone who rarely has 
pockets enough to fit a wallet and a phone, this is amazing! I can fit 
my card, 3 other gift cards and a couple bills in here!The only drawback is 
that it is not a tight seal. Sometimes I worry that my phone will pop 
out, but it won't. Once I placed my phone inside the case, the first thing 
I did was turn it upside down to see if my phone with fall out, 
no dice!Anyway, I think this phone case is amazing (I love the pastel pink!), and 
the buttons over the volume and screen are perfect! Not too hard but not too 
soft!
