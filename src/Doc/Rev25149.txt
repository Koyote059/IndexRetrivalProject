I was excited to have gotten this phone in spring of 2013. I upgraded from 
an iPhone 3GS (yes I know I am behind on the times here). The phone 
carried so much memory and data that I was able to keep up with the 
new data downloads or whatever you call it. I never once had to erase or 
delete my apps and camera roll (as what I had to to do with my 
iPhone 3GS).Let's fast forward...I only used the phone for 11 months. Just right after I 
upgraded it to the new iOS (Spring 2014), my iPhone 4 acted up badly!! I 
couldn't get out of an app for how many times I hit the "home" button. 
It drove me crazy. And I couldn't even get into my call screen without having 
to hit home so many more times. I hated my phone because of the iOS 
that was downloaded at the time.I parted ways with my iphone4 (it was a sad 
moment) and left AT&T to be with Verizon.Verizon embraced me and got me the iPhone 
5s. Yes it was a huge leap from the early iphone 4 to now an 
IPhone 5s (yea I felt like I was ballin' like a rockstar....until iphone 6 came 
out and then I ran out of memory on my 16gb iPhone 5s)....yea just because 
I left my iPhone 4 32gb for an IPhone 5s 16gb; I sure miss all 
those extra stored memory of my iphone4. It's not always greener on the other side. 
But damn that iOS upgrade that ruined my iPhone 4, otherwise me and the iPhone 
4 would still be together no matter of upgraded phones I could've gotten. :(
