i was a little wary because nowhere in the description does it say it's new. 
When it came I knew right away it was new. Nobody packages their phone like 
apple. Yes it did have a Verizon sim in it but that doesn't mean it's 
locked. The CSR at my carrier, Consumer Celluar, was able to determine it was unlocked 
and the transition was flawless. Yes it's a tad smaller then the iPhone 5s and 
if you have big fingers this maybe a problem. Also you Will need a nano 
SIM card for this phone. This same phone is available from Walmart for about the 
same price, I don't know what commitment is required for their Straight Talk no contract 
service.
