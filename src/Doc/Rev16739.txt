Everything came in better shape than I thought it would. No scratches or dents in 
the phone; it was as good as brand new. The only problem is that now 
it occasionally says my sim card cant be detected and forces me to restart my 
phone which I've never had that problem with my sim card before. It came with 
certain AT&T apps installed on the phone but it wasn't a problem disabling the apps 
through the settings. All in all, it was a good purchase, and three months later 
I still have no problems.
