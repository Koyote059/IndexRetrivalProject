I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and it was the right choice. 
I tried it out first and compared it to my iPhone. It held up very 
well and that's why I gave it 4 stars. It's not as good as an 
iPhone but it is less expensive and holds up well. Surely good enough for a 
teenager who isn't ripe enough for such an expensive phone.
