Phone is great for the money Ca $50, except that is slow. I am Nokia 
user and this is slow. The simple comand given to call last number with Green 
phone buttom it takes min 6 sec. With my prevouse Nokias was immidiate.The writing names 
to phones is similar with Erricson option of picking the letter. Also waste of time 
and energy.This is what I don't like in this phone other than it is OK.
