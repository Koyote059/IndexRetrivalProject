Love this IPhone ,,, although not the most modern model from apple compared to my 
old motorola phone I had before this phone is like going from day to night 
big big difference ,,, is worth every dollar I pay , very very happy with 
this purchase ..I've heard some criticism here in some comments about the phone not being 
unlocked !! ,,, no problem ,,, at&t is doing it very easy for people who 
buy old models iphones to unlock any i phone for free !!! if you buy 
a new older models or used from business like amazon or you buy it from 
someone else at&t will , unlocked at no charge ,, I did unlock my purchase 
for free in the At&t web side if you Iphone is three year old and 
has no pending contract with at&t and has no history of being stolen or history 
prematurely canceled contracts from the original owner with at&t this in case you buy a 
used ) they will unlocked for free !!! ...,,
