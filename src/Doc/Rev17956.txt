2 Weeks into the note 4 life things are going awesome. Then one afternoon while 
using my phone the screen goes blank. I try and try and try to get 
it back but to no avail. After doing research on research i found out that 
i had to factory reset the device which i did and it work. Long story 
short IM NOT IMPRESSED THAT AFTER 2 WEEKS OF USING THIS PHONE i have to 
go through this. I'll now be monitoring this device for a period of time to 
decide if i will be returning or not. Really hate having to write this review 
things were going too good. Will update soon
