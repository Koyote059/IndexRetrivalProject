Amazon does not have an option of giving a product zero starts - that is 
what this phone deserves. Bought two of these, one for myself one for my daughter. 
Good battery life, good size for me, SD cars. Last thing I expected from Sony 
was such a poor quality. One of our phones had to be repaired (takes about 
a month under warranty). Glass on the back cracked on mine a few month ago 
for no apparent reason as I can't recall dropping it. The cover for sim card 
slot would not stay closed all the way in from day 1. So called "proximity 
sensor" started giving me hard time during calls - screen would go off as soon 
as I hit call button and won't turn on. Sometimes it won't rotate - had 
to do reset to factory settings and spent hours getting things where they were after 
that. Finally mine died yesterday. I installed so called "software update" pushed out by Sony. 
Installed fine, restarted the phone, started "updating apps" when it say "update app X from 
N", crashed and won't even turn on anymore.Good design and terrible product IMO. Good buy 
Sony, good buy Android, hello Apple.
