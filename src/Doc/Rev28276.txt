Out of the box, despite being new and still factory sealed, the IMEI was bad, 
and didn't match what was on the box. After about 3 hours of struggling with 
it and my carrier (AT&T), even going to the extent of getting a new SIM, 
the screen and keyboard started becoming erratic and hyper responsive. Several resets later, nothing changed. 
I was very excited about the Priv, being a long-time Blackberry fan, but getting a 
device DOA and having to return it the same day I got it was very 
disappointing. The device also gets ridiculously hot, on or off the charger. Going back to 
my Moto X Pure.
