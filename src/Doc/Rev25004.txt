Bad deal. I don't like it since I received it. it seemed for me like 
it was used but at the same time everything was still in boxes. I bought 
it in August, it started to seriously overheating on October and in November it started 
to loose charge after few minutes of use. the battery charge shows like 50% and 
all of sudden it turns off because battery is not charged.
