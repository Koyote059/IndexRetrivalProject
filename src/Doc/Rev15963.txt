Came with a battery that was not so great, needs to charge often (and yes, 
I'm really good at setting it up so it doesn't drain battery fast; no, this 
isn't software, data, gps, or screen related). The battery will last for about 4 hours 
before it needs a recharge. Good phone otherwise, well packaged, clean, and no software issues. 
Other than the bad battery that requires a portable charger, it came in the condition 
it was advertised in.
