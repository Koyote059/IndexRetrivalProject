I've had this phone for about a week and it's worth the wait and price! 
It wasn't in stock when I ordered it so I had to wait about 3weeks 
for delivery and I got it for under $200 which was a really nice price. 
It does look like the newer iPhone, when I ordered it I was worried the 
gold color would be too yellow like in the picture but it's actually almost a 
rose gold. I did have an issue with my data not working for the first 
few days and my provider didn't have a solution, I had to contact Blu directly 
for help and I've got to say that they provide a great service. I had 
to call them a few times as we were trouble shooting and the longest I 
waited for someone to help me was about 10 minutes. The forward camera is 5MP 
and it's not great but I'm not one for selfies so it's fine and the 
other camera is 13 MP, also not amazing but it gets the job done. If 
I want a super crisp picture I'll just use my actual camera.
