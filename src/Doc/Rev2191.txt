The phone is what it is. It's a generation or two or three or ten 
back smartphone. It has horrible battery life, because that's what was available when this phone 
was made. It is increasingly limited in apps because it's such an old model. But 
it works exactly as it is supposed to, and for that, I give it 5 
stars. It is priced perfectly appropriately for its age and features. We had this model 
when it was new, and then passed it to the kids for the aps, and 
then I needed to replace one because I shattered the screen. Easy replacement.It did NOT 
have an SD card, and that may be a huge deal breaker. All I had 
to do was transfer over the card from the phone we already had.
