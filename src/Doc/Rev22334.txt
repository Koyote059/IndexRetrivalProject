this is not a usa phone even though it is said so in the product 
description.It got exposed when we try to install samsung pay.samsung pay doesnt work because not 
a USA phone.someone responded back after talking to samsung guys that this phone is a 
europe phone.Note 5 is good but i think seller is cheating in a way saying 
it is a USA phone.
