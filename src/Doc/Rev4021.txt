I ordered three of these phones, one for everyone in my family. They arrived promptly, 
but the sealing sticker for each of the boxes was broken, and one of the 
phones had an old (Verizon) SIM card in it, so it had clearly been used 
before. Also, it wasn't mentioned anywhere in the product description, but the phones seem to 
be intended for use in Mexico. They work in the US because GSM is an 
international standard, but all of the documentation and user manuals are in Spanish only. When 
you do a factory reset on the phone, it defaults to Spanish as well. So 
to summarize: the phone I got was used, and none of the documentation is in 
English.The phone itself seems like a good product, but I would not buy from this 
seller again (Voltage Converter Store).
