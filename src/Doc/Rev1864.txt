The phone came a day early so was happy in that regards, People alway ask 
please tell us before you put any neg feed back on them, This is why 
I didn't, The phone came with 180 phone number of who ever owned this phone 
before me but was a contractor and as soon as I put in my sims 
card all them number went on to my card, so had to deleit one at 
a time, very time consuming, They should of cleared the phone before they ever shiped 
it and got rid of his photo's also, Battery lasted maybe an hour so I 
had to buy one of them also, Can buy ring tones but can't put them 
on the phone, Another $10 buck, No instuctions but I'm sure there is a way 
but haven't found it yet. Phone does work and has good signal strenght happy with 
that, Takes bad pictures but I heard the tundra does so no fault from the 
seller there. Phone is what they said it was inregards to condition. But the hasel 
that I went though warrents that I buy else where in the future, Number's-Photo's-Battery, As 
I have bought two other phones on amazon that were great but I broke, Why 
I wanted a tundra. Thanks
