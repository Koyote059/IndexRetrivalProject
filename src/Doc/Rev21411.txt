great device BUT...your stuck with prepaid which dont auto bill so youre constantly hunting down 
a carrier.does not work with normal email or photo im or video im. internet works 
but most features disabled due to newer tech that came out since it was made. 
good idea but nobody maintained it, even hp. love the palm platform.
