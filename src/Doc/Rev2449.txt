I admit to having dropped the phone a few times. This was an exact replacement 
to one that was misplaced. I couldn't believe how much I had to pay for 
this phone. It is very touchy. Calls people, doesn't tell me when calls come in 
or texts when in battery save mode (figured that out when people complained I had 
not gotten back to them). Can't wait till December when I can replace it for 
free.
