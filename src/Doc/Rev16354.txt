I bought the phone via the vendor 'deal in the box'.The phone is not unlocked. 
It is at&t locked. I called the vendor and he send me an unlock code. 
Then i found some numbers in the call log. So i called HTC and let 
them check the IMEI. They confirmed that the phone has been activated a year ago.Also 
the phone itself had a scratch and the user guidebook looked very self-made. (Kodak photopaper 
for the cover and the pages have been cut inappropriate.) The Box looked like it 
has been used several times.There is no notice of the warranty mentioned in the warranty.The 
phone went back on the day i recieved it.
