I waited quite some time before writing this review. Loved it at first UNTIL AT&T 
updated my phone to the latest Android version. NOW I am thinking of replacing it 
as it add more and more quirks every day. For example, when I am looking 
for a specific contact in the "contacts," my phone opens up the AT&T contacts list. 
In the past, I would just hit the back arrow to get out of that 
list and get into my google contacts list. NOW it won't quit opening up the 
AT&T contacts list, even AFTER I hit the back arrow. It just keeps trying to 
load a non-existent AT&T list. My MMS on my text messaging also quit working after 
receiving the update. I can no longer receive or send MMS messages, which can get 
very frustrating for those who are sending them to me. I use Straight Talk for 
my cell service and of course, no one in Tech Support there seems to know 
how to change the settings on this phone so that my MMS will start working 
again. The phone itself works fine - it's just the pesky settings that need to 
get changed and since I am NOT nor will I EVER return to AT&T, I 
am stuck w/these types of idiosyncrasies (along w/new ones) that keep popping up as AT&T 
has somehow locked me from changing a few of the settings. Frustrating.
