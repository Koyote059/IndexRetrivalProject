I just got this phone and so far am extremely pleased with it. The tutorial 
is a great intro to the phone features. The trackpad makes the screen easy to 
navigate. I also made a call with it and call quality is fairly good--the friend 
I called had just gotten a new T-Mobile phone, so not sure if the slight 
echo was on my end or hers. I got used to the keyboard fairly quickly 
and have sent a few texts. Although the keys may be smaller than other models, 
I was still able to text with no trouble. The battery wasn't fully charged so 
it's charging now. Not sure about battery life, but will see how long it takes 
me to go through a full battery.This phone has so many great features, is light 
and easy to use--even for someone like me, who hasn't had a smart phone before.
