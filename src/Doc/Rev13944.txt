I've had this Samsaung model for about two years. This is one of the first 
models using their earlier Android 2.1 operating system. No updates to the later 4.0 or 
later systems. Users can download to Android 4.1 but have to erase the entire memory 
bank to do so. T-Mobile is the bigger problem as this was an intro model 
giving initial 4G cell service, Thier map shows 4G in Colorado, but I don't get 
it everywhere, so their 4G service is skimpy in Northern Colorado, thus 4 star rating. 
Overall it does everything I needed with several additional apps, but their 4G service isn't 
the best for website browsing! I feel the Samsung is satisfactory and will update to 
a newer model soon and probably a different carrier with better 4G service!
