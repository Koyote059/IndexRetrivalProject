I thought these were a hellaciously good deal so I got several of these for 
our family. After using them for awhile the biggest complaint I have is that the 
phone randomly locks up multiple times a day. It lags really bad after a few 
uses and god help you if you try to make back to back calls, because 
it simply won't work. It won't let you hang up, find another number, and immediately 
place a call. You have to wait a minute (literally) and then, if you're lucky, 
it will work. I have antivirus installed and know that the phone is clean. It's 
great with using apps and overall I like the phone. It's just a few quirks 
that irritate me and prevent me from giving it a better review. It's still not 
bad for the money. I really am hard on phones - I use them constantly 
and work them non-stop (internet, calls, texts, etc). I'm overall happy with it and you 
can't beat the price.
