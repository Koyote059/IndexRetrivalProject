I THOUGHT that I liked this phone. I am an AT&T customer and didn't want 
to sign up for a new contract nor did I want to pay three times 
what a phone is worth to get it from them. All good until I went 
to actually try to link this to our data plan. Basically, the way that this 
is made, the best I can get with this phone together with AT&Ts network is 
2G!! I am not willing to pay a monthly data fee for 2G. If that 
isn't enough to discourage you, try this: We went to the Chicago Blues Festival this 
past weekend and I had NO PHONE SERVICE! My husband called them and was told 
that we could go to such-and-such address there near our hotel to deal with it 
but I didn't really want to waste time (at $375 per night) trying to get 
the phone to work.
