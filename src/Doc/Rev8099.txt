I bought this phone trying to avoid the cost of purchasing the phone I really 
wanted which was the Note 2. Right of the bat the phone looks very nice 
and its pretty fast. The screen size is really nice, camera takes so so pictures 
it just depends on what mood the camera is in. I already noticed some of 
the features that are not available and thats the google search bar and google talk.CONSHeres 
the problems i had with the phone running on 3g1. I couldnt really hear people 
very well while driving and the voices of the people have high treble but no 
bass2. The phones dial pad doesnt go away even when you are talking on the 
phone the light remains on.3. Battery life off a full charge doesnt last past 5 
to six hours.4. Gps was never found, it would say searching for gps satellite like 
forever.5. internet was so so, it would connect when it wanted to.6. No google talk 
at all and no google search bar, no gmail but you can always download Gmail 
but you cannot DOWNLOAD a legit google search bar or google talk, I know because 
I tried.7. When you text you will always see either SIM 1 or SIM 2 
because of the dual sim card mode on this phone you have to select what 
sim you have selected on the phone, not a problem really but its just a 
little lame.8. ending a call is a little difficult because you have to turn the 
phone on before you can end a call.9. NO groups for your contacts list, it 
just doesnt exist.Pros.1. the phone functions fast apart from the internet2. texting is very good3. 
wifi works well4. the resolution is very clear5. the price is a lot better than 
buying the note 2and thats about it folks, all in all I rather just get 
my money back. The phone looks hopeful out of the package but once you get 
the chance to use it its really not what you thought it would be.
