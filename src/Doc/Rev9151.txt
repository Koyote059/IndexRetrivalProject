We absolutely love this phone. This phone has awesome sound compared to our other smart 
phones. You can take pictures while videoing and it does not glitch in the playback 
where the picture was taken. The reviews pros and cons are pretty accurate. The champagne 
is that light gold color, looks very nice. We are using it with a straight 
talk plan. Still getting use to it, I'm sure more things will wow us as 
we discover them. It's a bit of money upfront, but not a bad price overall. 
There's a few specs that would have been nice to see, but maybe the next 
phone they design will have it all. The size is not bad. Not too big, 
but great for photos (takes nice pics), surfing the net, watching a show, etc. Feels 
well built, the battery has been lasting well each day. Has not gotten hot like 
some reviews I've read. So far we are very happy with this phone and would 
do it again.
