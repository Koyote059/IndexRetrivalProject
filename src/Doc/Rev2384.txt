I bought this one for my wife . So overall the build quality of the 
phone is good , no plastic squicky sound and so on. Interface is very smooth 
thanks to a powerfull Qualcomm MSM8660 Snapdragon 1,5 GHZ DualCore processor and Adreno 220 Graphics 
chip and this is why battery litterally dies in front of one's eyes ! With 
normal usage of 3-4 hours the battery icon starts blinking red and makes me nervously 
look for a charger . Other than that the unit is a great smartphone . 
4 stars for weak battery
