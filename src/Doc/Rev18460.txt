I was looking for a cheap but awesome cellphone as i got stolen my S3.I 
couldn't be more happier with my pick. This cell phone has everything any kind of 
user needs with such nice Windows Phone 8 OS. I don't miss my previous cell 
phone at all, it is really easy to use, it has plenty of cool games 
and there are enough apps for everything.A friend has the Lumia 920, but we have 
not found many differences so far. Just a better camera (but 5mpx are more than 
enough for me), and bigger screen. Thats all.. The performance is exactly the same, however 
I've not tried heavy games, just Dragon Blade DX, Final fantasy, Plants Vs Zombies which 
runs really really great.I would recommend this Cellphone for everyone.There is just one small con, 
which is that Whatsapp runs quite slowly, but I think we might get an update 
very soon. Same with YouTube official application which I expected it to be released in 
a couple of weeks, or a month.
