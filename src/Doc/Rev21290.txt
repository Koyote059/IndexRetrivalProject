For anyone who just needs a smartphone for a decent price, this is the phone 
to go with. With that being said, don't expect some Galaxy S7 quality when using 
this phone, but it is pretty good at holding its own. The one thing that 
surprised me was that this has a 5MP front camera and a 13MP back camera 
when the specs on Amazon are a tad different. I bought 2 of these phones, 
one in white and one in gold. Both have the same features and are used 
by 2 different people who have no complaints about the phone. Memory is a bit 
limited on this phone, but a microSD card is supported and I highly recommend grabbing 
one if you use your phone to store a lot. I currently have it running 
on Lollipop 5.0.2 but it is has an update pending so it can go a 
bit more than that. Other unique thing about this phone is that it has a 
LED flash on both sides of the phone, so all photos will remain bright. In 
general, I would suggest this phone to someone who is either waiting for the next 
flagship and needs a temporary phone or for someone who needs the capabilities of a 
smartphone at a low price. RAM is 1.5GB on the Samsung Galaxy J5 while average 
smartphone RAM is 2GB and flagship level is 4GB now. It can run a fair 
amount of processes, but I haven't tried any heavy duty things on the phone. I 
didn't give it 5 stars because finding accessories for this phone are a little harder 
in the U.S. because this isn't that mainstream of a phone.
