TL: DR: awesome phone, I enjoy WP8 platform, I question how "new" this phone was 
when I received itI really enjoy this phone. For reference I've had an iPhone before 
making the switch to a Samsung Focus Windows phone, and then replaced that with the 
Nokia 920.***The pluses for Windows Phone 8***+ Live tiles are great and give loads of 
info at a glance. I considered getting a new iPhone or Android phone but the 
lack of a Live Tile analog killed that idea. I've come to depend on them. 
Basically each app icon is a tile, occupying space on the main screen. Those tiles 
display bite sized bits of info so you don't have to open the program to 
see new info. For example, new emails show the first couple sentences, meeting info shows 
up on your calendar tile, etc+ Great phone for business users - MS Office integration, 
Live Tiles+ Cool xbox live integration+ Good social integration if you are into that. A 
continuous feed of Facebook/Linked in updates in one place+ Tile UI is cleaner, more usable 
than the iphone/android phones I've compared. I liken those UI's to a desktop computer cluttered 
with shortcut icons.+ Separate inboxes for all my email accounts***The Minuses for Windows Phone 8***- 
The marketplace is not nearly as robust as the iPhone or Android market. However if 
you are like me, you only use 1% of the stuff you download - the 
important stuff - and that is fully represented on the marketplace.***Pluses for the Lumia 920***+ 
Feels sturdy. Looks big and bulky to carry in pocket, but I don't notice it 
when I do.+ Beautiful display. This was a standout for me in the ATT store 
doing comparisons with other phones.+ Stunning night pictures - this aspect of the camera really 
impressed me. Very high detail photos+ Runs fast - apps open fast+ Decent battery life. 
I'm a heavy user and I can usually get away with charging it when I 
get home at night and having a day's charge the next day.+ Gorilla glass prevents 
most scratches+ Good call quality+ Speakerphone is pretty good, but volume perhaps a little low+ 
Infinitely better than the Samsung Focus I had.***Minuses for the Lumia 920***- The Nokia Drive 
app (think Google maps navigation) is really hit and miss sometimes.- Day shots with the 
camera can look blurry on occasion- I never had a protective case - dropped it 
many times without issue - but one drop smashed the entire display. But like I 
said, I did not use a protective case.AS FOR THIS SELLER: I have to question 
how *new* this phone was when I received it. This is actually my second 920 
since my cat knocked mine off the table, hitting it just right and smashing the 
display. I was searching for a way to get a new phone without paying a 
ridiculous amount of $$$ since I was not ready for upgrade discount. When I pulled 
the laminate off the screen I noticed a number of very small micro-scratches. A brand 
new factory-sealed phone would not have these scratches. I wonder if this was a used 
phone that could pass for new, and then someone cleaned it up for resale. I'm 
speculating here, but the micro-scratches seem suspicious to me. But I did get this far 
below what my carrier would charge me.My advice, get the phone, but buyer beware when 
using this seller.
