Avoid this product as well as FGS Trading (the Amazon seller that supplied my phone). 
The phone worked beautifully for 6 months. After an over the air update, the phone 
now freezes at the Samsung logo. I am told that this is the sudden death 
bug that affects the hardware on the Note 2 and some S3's. I have been 
trying to get the phone serviced for the last 3 weeks which should be trivial 
since it has a 24 month warranty. Guess again. FGS Trading says that after 60 
days they will not support it. Samsung USA cannot service it since it is international. 
Samsung UK service center cannot accept a shipment from outside the UK. No one has 
a record of the IMEI number or the country of origin for this "factory unlocked 
phone". Still no headway with Amazon's A-Z guarantee. You have been warned.** UPDATE **It is 
now 7 weeks since my phone died after the over the air update. Amazon A-Z 
keeps denying my claim because they want letterhead saying the phone is under warranty. Samsung 
USA won't touch the device since it was manufactured in France. Found a Samsung help 
Center in UK and they verified the date of manufacturer indicating the phone is still 
eligible for 24 month warranty but that they cannot provided letterhead. Forwarded the email to 
Amazon A-Z service. They are still denying my claim on the basis that it is 
not on letterhead. Call in help desk at Amazon is polite and tries to be 
helpful. But there is no way to send emails, call or in anyway directly contact 
the Amazon A-Z claims people even to give them the information they request. The Amazon 
A-Z guarantee so far is headache, smoke and mirrors. Hopefully you will never have to 
depend on them especially to back a $700 defective product.
