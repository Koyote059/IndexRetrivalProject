Google is now discontinuing the Nexus 5 with the recent release of the Nexus 6. 
I did not like the idea of such a big phone/phablet, so I ordered the 
unlocked Nexus 5 for use in Mexico. I have yet to see a better performing 
phone. Yes, it could do with a better camera, but overall it is an impressive 
piece of hardware. Get it while you still can.
