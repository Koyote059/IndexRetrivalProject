The Nokia 5800 XPressMusic is smart, with good quality and complete.Notable are the Carl Zeiss 
Camera, GPS Navigation capability andultra-fast EDGE Internet connection. No complaints about thiswonderful product, only (maybe) 
more MPixels in the Camera and alittle more precision in the touch-screen response.Is one of 
the cheapest middle-high-range touchscreen smartphones.And with the excellence of the Nokia brand...I will recommend it 
a 100%.
