I was so excited taking this phablet out of the box. It looks great. I 
got anew sim for it and was ready. Unfortunately blu studio wasn't ready for me. 
I am practically attached to my devices. I do everything but make calls on my 
phones it seems. Stream movies, play games, read books, text, email , the whole nine. 
The studio cannot stand up to the things I'm used to having my phones do. 
The phone constantly freezes. It will shut off and power cycle even if I'm not 
touching it. Another aggravating thing is the phone won't power on if it's connected to 
the charger. It hasn't been a month and I've been ready to replace it for 
weeks now.
