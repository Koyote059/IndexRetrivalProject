Not a horrible phone, but the screen freezes and scratches and the upgrade to Lollipop 
seems not to be in the works. Customer support is ok, but I wish that 
Lollipop was here!I also think the camera doesn't work well with some of my banking 
apps!UPDATE OCT 6 Customer ServiceDue to technical issues BLU said that they will replace the 
phone. Sounds good until they say that I have to return the broken phone first 
and then have a 15-20 day turnaround time. That really is unacceptable in this day 
and age.
