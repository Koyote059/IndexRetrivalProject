I was so excited to get this phone, but the phone stopped working after 2-days. 
The power button is stuck inside the case, causing the phone to constantly turn off/on 
until the battery died. The first day, the power button got stuck twice, so I 
was already pretty concerned about the build quality. But then today, the 2nd day, it 
got stuck and now I can't even get the button out to make the phone 
usable.I should note that the earpiece speaker volume wasn't very loud and the battery drained 
rather quickly. I can understand and accept the battery, considering the phone specs are really 
great. But the low earpiece volume and stuck power button are deal killers for me. 
I'm returning the phone to Amazon.
