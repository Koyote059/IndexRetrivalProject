Purchased an unlocked version on Amazon.com not knowing what to expect. I'm not a major 
app user and was just looking for a more user-friendly phone with some more upside 
potential than my old flip phone. Pleasantly surprised - absolutely now problems with the quality 
or reliability after the first couple months use.
