I like it, it works well and costs a lot less than my Samsung Galaxy. 
The only complaint I have is for some reason the day and date stays the 
same on my calendar app. The phone knows and shows me the correct date everywhere 
else, I open the app and the correct day is marked it's also correct when 
I see it on the lock screen or anywhere else but the most important spot 
where I don't have to dig to find out continues to say Monday the 23rd! 
I would like there to be more options for ring tones for notifications because it's 
the same if I get a text, email or instant message ect... I do enjoy 
the camera however but keep in mind if you do buy it you will have 
to focus it sometimes yourself by touching the screen and waiting until the box turns 
green meaning it's focused. That's fairly simply now if I could find a way to 
get the calendar to show the correct date as it sits on my home screen 
and its what I go to if I don't know the date. The OCD in 
me is flipping out! Also make sure you can keep your phone plan as metro 
PCS did not inform me when I switched that because the phone didn't come from 
them I could not keep my unlimited 4g which is a really s***ty thing to 
do since when I reached my miniscule amount of 4g that they switched me to 
is when I found out what and literally at that exact second the video I 
was watching shut off and went to buffering. I honestly think this is some sort 
of scam they are running to get more money because 3g was never that slow. 
It's pretty decent but they sure let me know that by buying a phone they 
didn't provide they were gonna screw me over since I didn't give them every last 
cent of money. But overall the phone itself is great but if you can't use 
it at the speeds you intended then it kind of defeats the purpose...
