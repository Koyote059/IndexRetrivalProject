Bought this for my wife, so I'm not 100% sure on how it is performing. 
She hasn't complained about it, so it must be getting the job done. It was 
a good buy at the price, and transferring her old number over to the new 
phone was fairly easy. I was able to complete the job over the phone with 
our local TMobile store. She was on a pay-as-you-go plan, which did not have any 
data on it. We were able to get the "WalMart only" $30-a-month unlimited data and 
text w/ 100 minutes talk just by asking the rep for it on the phone.
