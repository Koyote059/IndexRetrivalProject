I have just bought the mobile (one month ago), so far has been good, however 
I was used to customize a lot more the way my phone looks like (keyboard, 
screen, themes, etc) and what I see on the screen (since this HTC has sense 
5.5 I can't remove blinkfeed from the main screen), unfortunatelly this phone has restrictions to 
do so (sad for me), despite of that the phone meet my spectations, lets see 
what happen later.
