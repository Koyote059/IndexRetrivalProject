I purchased 2 of these phones for my kids and after just a few weeks, 
they are already complaining that the phone freezes. They have to remove the battery and 
sometimes reset the phone to factory settings to get it to be responsive again. Not 
sure if it needs some updates or if the hardware is just not good. If 
anyone else has encountered these issues and has any fixes or work-arounds please let me 
know. Otherwise I will continue to troubleshoot and see if I am able to come 
up with a fix.
