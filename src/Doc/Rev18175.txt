Bought for my son and the SIM card doesn't fit. It's a standard SIM card 
these days (mini) from TMobile so it should work but the slots for the SIM 
cards are too big. I even tried the scotch tape trick another reviewer posted and 
turned the card around every which way I could think of and it just wont 
fit enough to be recognized. Emailed BLU directly and all I got was instructions to 
hard reset. How exactly does a hard reset fix a problem that others clearly have?!
