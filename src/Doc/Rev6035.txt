The best one up to now... I was scared to use a windows phone after 
3 years using a Iphone, but it's surprised me... the gadget is good and works 
fine, and of course, the best camera ever...pros:easy to usegreat camerasync fine with Imaccons:touch technology 
is not so good as applecamera does not focus on closer images ( can not 
use some apps to scan bar codes )battery ends quickly ( there ways to avoid 
it, but.... )miss some apps that was not developed yet to windows phone
