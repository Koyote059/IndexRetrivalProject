I really wanted to like this phone, as it seems like a nice piece of 
hardware. As a Verizon customer, it just did not work for me. First, SMS messages 
that were more than 160 characters sent with strange characters attached (managed to work around 
that via an app). Next, data was inconsistent. Then, it became apparent I couldn't use 
data during a voice call, despite having voLTE activated. I also had some problems getting 
LTE at all. Returning.
