This is a good phone which give you flexibility. You can easily access basic information 
such as calendar, contacts and notes, but also can easily access your emails, and even 
a good GPS navigation system. I installed the Garmin GPS for Nokia and worked perfectly!!A 
bit larger screen would be a nice upgrade for the ESeries Nokia phones.
