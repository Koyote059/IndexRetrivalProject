Phone works the perfect the only thing is it doesn't seem to be brand new 
or was dropped durning shipping because the screen wasn't on completely and had to push 
it back down to get it attached again. was really surprised a company would send 
it out like this, i really need the replacement phone so couldn't send it back 
but so far its been working fine
