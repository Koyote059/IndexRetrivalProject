I wanted a cheap fitness tracker with clock.The Bad: The pedometer said unavailable, the sleep 
tracker said unavailable, and I could only find the sedentary alert once- don't know if 
that worked.The Middle: The band on it is huge. I'm a big girl that usually 
uses extra links in a watch, and I was on the second to last hole 
here. It's thicker and heavier than I expected, but I think I would get used 
to it.The Good: Even though I didn't want to connect it to my phone, it 
connected easily to my iPhone 6. I could get my music, even though it wasn't 
very loud. I liked the idea of an FM radio. Even though the headphones didn't 
fit, good sound quality.
