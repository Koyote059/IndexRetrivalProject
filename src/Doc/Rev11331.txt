Very pleased with this phone. Found out I could have purchased elsewhere at a lower 
price (*at the Cricket wireless store for $100), but I always have great success with 
Amazon and would rather just stick with proven results.Many functions, substantial speed, excellent camera, and 
my service under Cricket wireless is exceptional. All around great phone...I've had tremendous experiences with 
Samsung...and I'm still not sure why some people would spend $600-$800 for a phone when 
this one has everything a person should need.
