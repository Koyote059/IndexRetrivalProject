I bought this phone with some reservations after viewing all the ratings and reviews that 
people had written.The phone was fullfilled by Coldwater LLC (Phone Etc).When I received the phone, 
I immediately charged the battery overnite before even trying the phone. I also bought a 
SIM from Straight Talk to activate the phone on the Straight Talk 45 dollar plan.The 
next morning, I inserted the SIM and the AmazonBasics 16 GB microSDHC Class 10 Flash 
Memory Card I had bought. I activated the phone on Straight Talk and turned the 
phone on. I updated the APN to the Straight Talk settings. Everything on the phone 
worked perfectly. I was also surprised to see that the phone had been updated to 
2.35. The box had said 2.1.I have had no problems with the phone at all. 
Battery typically lasts about 2-3 days for me and is down to 30-40% at that 
point. I typically keep the GPS and bluetooth turned off and turn WIFI off on 
the road. At home, I primarily use WIFI for my data.
