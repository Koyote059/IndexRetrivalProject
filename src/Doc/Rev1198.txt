This item operates fine as a phone that makes calls and sends texts. I wasn't 
able to receive or send (MMS) pictures. However I think that I just needed to 
change some settings. I tried to get 4G using my ATT sim card but was 
never able to. I couldn't get 3G either. It operated on "edge" but perhaps that 
could have improved with APN changes or something but while surfing on the internet it 
really wasn't that much slower than my Galaxy Note. Audio is a little too low 
even at highest setting. Truth is the camera on the phone was so bad that 
I didn't spend too much time checking out many of the phone's other features. The 
picture quality is the worst I have seen long time. If you want a phone 
with a camera that you can take decent pictures with...THEN DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!!. Actually 
this review can be given lower rating simply because of the camera...that's if having one 
thing to carry to make calls and occasionally take decent pictures is important to you...............................UPDATE....................................................... 
RETURNED THIS PHONE ........PURCHASED THE BLU LIFE PLAY!!!!!!!!! LOVE IT....HAD IT FOR MORE THAN A 
WEEK....ENJOY IT MORE EVERYDAY.......IT'S WORTH CHECKING OUT. CHECK OUT THE REVIEWS NOT JUST HERE....ALL OVER 
THE INTERNET.
