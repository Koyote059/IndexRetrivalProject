First things first, the reasons why I bought this phone were that I'll be travelling 
quite a lot for a while and need to be reachable, I was not in 
the market for anything over-the-top expensive, and I preferred to stay in the Android ecosystem. 
My company used the Talk Abroad Lite (also manufactured by Blu), and my aunt had 
bought a Life Play last summer and she doesn't regret it, so I said, why 
the hell not.The best sentence to sum it up is, you get what you pay 
for. 13 megapixels in the back, 5 megapixels in the front, a 1080p screen, 32 
gigs of storage, and 2 gigs of RAM for under $300, you know there must 
be some corners cut here and there, if comparable devices form other manufacturers go upwards 
of $600. And insides made by Mediatek is more then enough proof of that.Personally it 
doesn't bother me, as long as I get my phone calls and emails and the 
occasional time-killing (2D) game to work properly. And it's more than adequate on those fronts. 
Anything in need of high performance I leave for my Nexus 7 to handle.So if 
you're looking for something to go head-to-head with the likes of Samsung, HTC or Sony 
flagships, look elsewhere, maybe at the dual-SIM versions of those phones. Otherwise, if you don't 
have any great expectations other than a workhorse for business/travelling, give this a shot.
