I got 3 such devices. somehow they all came pre-rooted with isr firmware (bought from 
US and sent to US). all 3 are kitkat but fail upgrading via LG suite. 
Not all 3 have the same revision of the firmware.2 of the devices lose the 
touch and force me to open them, remove and re-insert the battery once a day 
to reactivate the touch.The third device is ok regarding its screen but cannot connect to 
a PC.I ldon't live in the US so sending them back to the seller is 
impossible. I asked them about the pre-rooted firmware to which they replied that they don't 
know what rooting is.One bad phone is something that happens, but 3 bad phones in 
one short domestic shipment is a huge red flag.I suspect these are all refurbished or 
worse but sold as new . beware.
