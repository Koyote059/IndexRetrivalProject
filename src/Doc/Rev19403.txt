First of all, they wrote ( Like NEW ) and it never was at all. 
Second, when I got it, it was scratch all over the phone but i accepted 
it. Third, I just used it for only one month then suddenly the screen not 
working at all. I took it to two different places to fix the screen or 
replace it, the first one asked for $160 and the second one asked for $100. 
Then they told me that the phone opened before and the speaker has been changed 
with another old one. When I contacted with the seller he said that it was 
over 40 days and he will never accept to returned back again. I paid almost 
$400 for an old and opened phone then I'm gonna pay additional $100 to fix 
it!! This is so unfair. So, please if any one read this DON'T EVER BUY 
FROM THIS SILLER AT ALL!!
