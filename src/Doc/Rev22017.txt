This phone is great! My previous phone was a Droid X (antique). This phone allowed 
me to move over with a minimal learning curve. I travel for a living and 
depend on my phone much more than the average person. I use apps for everything 
from renting cars to making restaurant reservations, and modes of travel (airline, train), calendar, email, 
etc. This phone is plenty quick and powerful to handle my needs. Also, it was 
unlocked and very easy to program to my network. Slipped in a sim card, made 
a phone call and I was good!
