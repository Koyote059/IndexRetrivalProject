I bought this phone about a month ago and I was really happy with it! 
It doesn't look too cheap, even though the price is really good, the photos were 
great (that was really important for me!) and the display has a good solution!While the 
4- and 5-star reviews list you all the good things about the phone, I want 
to let you know, what apperently some of the Huaweis P8 Lites have: A hardware 
problem that affects the WiFi. After a little over the week I noticed that my 
WiFi wasn't working anymore, and it said "Denied access to network". The WiFi worked perfectly 
when I was right next to the device where it comes from, but as soon 
as I'd go further away than around 5 feet, it didn't work again! I checked 
the internet and the support said it is a hardware problem, so you have to 
send it back to Amazon.So right before I wanted to send it back, my WiFi 
worked again, so I didn't do anything.But one month and one day after I got 
the phone, I had the same problem again, only this time it wouldn't go away 
again by itself! So I called Amazon support and I am really happy that I 
can still return it, even though it would have been too late for that (after 
a month)!So I'd really recommend this phone, but if you have the problem that I 
had, return the product right away, just to be sure!
