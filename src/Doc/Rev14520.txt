Upon receiving the item unboxed it and went through the list of what's included in 
the box and found out that the stereo headphone is missing. I then contacted Amazon.com, 
through email, about the missing piece, got a reply asking me if I want to 
send the LG KP500 Cookie back to them for a full refund but decided to 
keep the unit without the headphone. Amazon.com offered me $16.60 to be credited to my 
account as a token for the missing part. Two days after it was credited to 
my account. Amazon's customer service is excellent. I will keep ordering items from this guys.Anyway, 
I've read good reviews of this item and ordered it in replacement of my Palm 
Treo 680. I still like my Palm Treo for what it can do but sad 
to say it needs to retire. I was going to order the same item (Palm 
Treo 680) but decided to try and go with a touch screen. The LG KP500 
Cookie unlocked cellphone is in excellent condition. I inserted the sim card and took it 
for a test drive. The touch screen is very responsive, colors are vivid and true 
to life. No complaints about this item. Good price, nice looking touch screen phone.
