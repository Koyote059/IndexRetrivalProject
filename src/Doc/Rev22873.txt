i purchased this product because the info says UNLOCKED and im happy i've something to 
use when i travel outside USA --- it was one of my greatest disappointments i 
can not even use the cell phone with my T-Mobile SIM card while in Texas 
--- i went to a cell phone doctor and they failed to work on its 
""unlocked"" feature ----- i contacted the seller - gave me a procedure on how to 
unlock the system --- negative results ------ i went to Galveston Island and tossed the 
BB Tour 9630 right there in the Gulf Of Mexico :) :) :)
