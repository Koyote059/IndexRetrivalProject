Certainly a much needed upgrade from the ZenFone 2. I like it, easy to use. 
The finger print scanner works well as long as you have clean hands, I'd advise 
putting multiple prints into storage encase you get a cut. Overall it outperforms it's predecessor 
in every way, while keeping the same shape. Inserted my sim card from cricket and 
had no problems, getting a much better signal now. The default themes are a bit 
lacking, but it's easy enough to switch to another launcher platform to handle a wider 
variety of themes. There is a bit of bloatware, but it's not unmanageable, easy enough 
to take care of. My only concern is the way the camera on the back 
protrudes the phones shell, so I'll be getting a case just to even out that 
space. So far so good.
