I really want to give this thing more stars for the price, but the Android 
experience is really bothering me.I had KitKat on a tablet and the experience was just 
fine -but this gorgeous device is sadly infected with the lollipoop OS. The needing to 
clear cache bit to install updates or new programs issue with lollipoop is the most 
inconvenient issue I've ever encountered in an OS and the main reason I can't stand 
it -the second Facebook and trying to edit a post, but it glitches and repeats 
the typed text and won't stop repeating it as suggested text in web browser (because 
their app is crap).If there was enough support for this device as far as modding 
communities, then I'd probably be happier -or have totally bricked this thing by now.Slays me 
further that Google has now already announced Marshmallow OS and that it requires specific hardware 
specs. This may not see that much needed upgrade.I'm probably going to try Windows Phone 
next. BLU has solid phones, mobile OS just seems pretty lackluster.
