I've rated with one star because I received the phone a different color I bought. 
And it's unfair because I was so happy waiting for my phone and sent me 
what color you want and not the one I choose when purchasing.However, avoiding the big 
mistake, is a great phone, it's fast. ultra slim, luxurious design, lightweight, beautiful phone. and 
all at a great price, and that makes me very happy. They can buy the 
phone will not be disappointed, it is a good choice.I'm just disappointed not to receive 
the color of the phone I bought.Yes I am paying for a product and choose 
the color,it is expected to receive the selected product, not the one you want.I don't 
make a return the phone, because I live in Venezuela and I would very expensive 
to do that.I hope that next buy, you are more careful with their customers.and you 
can hopefully compensate me. Thank you.I am amazed!It is a great phone.Good performance.It's fast , 
design is nice, is lightweight,and has everything we want from a phone at a great 
price.
