The phone came in a factory sealed package as an AT&T GoPhone. On the package 
it was stated that the phone can ONLY be used with AT&T network. I visited 
an AT&T store where the sales rep told me in no uncertain terms that the 
phone is locked to AT&T and cannot be unlocked because it is not a smartphone. 
At this point I initiated a return with CellularGlobe. I did not want to try 
the phone because CellularGlobe return policy does not allow returns if the phone was ever 
"used". Next day I got an email from CellularGlobe stating that the phone is in 
fact unlocked, and if not they can provide the unlock code. They also assured me 
it is okay to try the phone, and that I can still return it afterwards. 
They were right about the former. My T-Mobile SIM card worked with the phone instantly. 
There is some AT&T software installed on the phone, which I am still unsure how 
to remove. The phone seems as advertised. I give 3 stars as I feel that 
the product description must mention that the phone comes in as an AT&T GoPhone, and 
that it is actually unlocked. It would save me time and hassle, and if I 
knew of all this AT&T software I probably would not buy the phone in the 
first place.
