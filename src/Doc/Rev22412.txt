I wouldn't recommend buying it online, the phone I got came good but then started 
acting weird. When I would send out pictures it would not send. Another thing is 
that when i plug in my earbuds they only work on one side. I checked 
with many other earbuds and its still the same side, so therefore the phone is 
defected. The warranty isn't good as well, they would not provide you with a replacement 
phone while they have it for repairs. Me as a business owner, I can't go 
without my phone over 12 hours.
