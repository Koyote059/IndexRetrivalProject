Device arrived two days earlier than expected!! Came in a regular box. Not a Galaxy 
box, but doesn't make a difference. Clean and well packaged. My service provider is AT&T. 
I simply switched my SIM card to the new phone, turned it on and did 
the setup as required for new devices. As soon as I slipped my SIM card 
in the device was doing what it was suppose to e doing!! Incoming/Outgoing calls and 
texting without ANY interruption.Love this devise for its colorful, bright pictur images. I owned one 
before, and had to have a another one!!
