Almost everything you would expect from a high dollar smart phone for a great price. 
I use it on t mobile and still get great service, although it is just 
a tad bit slower than my old phone but the battery life is pretty good. 
A few flaws are that it is not capable of screen casting, trying to live 
stream doesn't work well but that's probably because its only 4g and not 4g LTE 
capable. If you buy this phone be sure to buy and SD card as well 
because the phone system uses about 2.5 GB and the remaining 5.5 goes quick. Comes 
with soft rubber case and screen cover in the box
