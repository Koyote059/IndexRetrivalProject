It's a good phone ... Charges really fast with the given adapter... Battery life is 
decent,drains off by the end of the day. Camera, screen and speakers are decent. Overall 
the phone which sufficed my requirements.. the audio jack is a bit problamatic, it's kind 
of loose and the pin does not click-in the jack... I am not sure if 
this is a problem with my particular piece or with all the nexus5x. Wished they 
could have provided earphones with the phone. Overall a good phone.
