Overall the phone works well as long as you don't use the speaker. If I 
try to make a call with the speaker on, it aborts within 3-4 rings. If 
I leave the speaker off until it connects then turn it on, it garbles anything 
said on the other end so bad that you can't understand one word.The very strange 
thing about this is that the magicjack phone app works just fine with the speaker. 
So the problem seems to be strictly the actual phone call/speaker integration.Since I really like 
using the speaker for phone calls I suspect that I will be returning the phone.That 
said if you don't mind not being able to use the speaker the phone connects 
well with wifi, 3G, and Bluetooth. For the price would have gotten a 5 star 
rating otherwise.
