I bought this phone simply because it was cheap and I needed a phone ASAP 
when my other one was about to die. It is pretty simple to use and 
pretty basic all around, but it was too basic for me and I decided to 
spend a little more on another phone with more features.Note: This particular phone was released 
for the German market; (which I knew upon purchase) So, you must go in the 
controls to change it to English function and there is no American plug outlet.It's a 
good phone for someone looking for an entry-level "smarter" phone. It's easy to use and 
cheap.
