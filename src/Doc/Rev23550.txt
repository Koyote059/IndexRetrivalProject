The Nokia Lumia 820 is an excellent phone and windows 8 is very stable. Yes, 
the battery discharges very quickly and the slot for the mini SD card and the 
sim card are very hard to use. I bought this cell phone as factory unlocked 
but what I received was an AT&T cellphone with the code to unlocked.
