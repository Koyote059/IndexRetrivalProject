This has been the best purchase I could have ever made. The LGG4 has a 
very disappointing battery and I have discovered that my phone does not like to connect 
with chargers. I purchased this so that I could just trade out an almost dead 
battery for a fully charged battery and keep the cycle going. Despite this being a 
hassle I love this charger. It charges the battery via wall socket and charger cord. 
It has been working daily since I purchased it several months ago. I haven't had 
any issues with it at all and if you own an LGG4 I highly recommend 
you invest in this gem!
