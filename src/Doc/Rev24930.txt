The phone works pretty well and has a wealth of features, however.It has some quirks 
that were for me too cumbersome to overcome.In the case of answering the phone on 
incoming calls, it popped up a menu, of answer later, leave a message and so 
on with no way to answer the call.If that menu did not rear it's ugly 
head and you swiped to answer any direction except for the one very limited swipe 
it would hang up.If this were solved this would be a great phone.
