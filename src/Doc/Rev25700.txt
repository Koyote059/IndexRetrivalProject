Phone looks great does as expected. Sadly the battery is useless. After fully charging it 
still dies within two hours. Now that should have been stated in the sale listing 
too. Now off to buy a battery!!! I don't like dishonesty or failure to disclose. 
especially when it comes to this sort of item.
