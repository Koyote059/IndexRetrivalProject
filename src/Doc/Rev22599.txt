Purchased this phone in March and the phone worked well up until September. Apparently there 
is an issue with the power button malfunctioning and causing issue with the control board 
- phone constantly restarts, even after resetting it to manufactures original Android specs.Contacted the seller 
and he directed me to the manufacturer website, which i had already looked up. Contacted 
the manufacturer and after a lengthy two week process of finally receiving a replacement phone, 
the new phone they sent crashed. The "new" phone as promised by customer service was 
a refurbished phone and its control board crashed - this time the led display crashed. 
In short do not purchase this phone. I probly would recommend not purchasing a Blu 
Phone at all especially with the way they process warranty claims. Seller is not at 
fault, just don't purchase the phone.
