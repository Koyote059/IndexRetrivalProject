This is my second C3. My other one lasted about 4 years....and NEVER needed a 
new battery. I wish it had a more powerful camera, but that is my only 
real complaint. Be careful when you buy it...my other one had a more standard QWERTY. 
This one is basically fine, but it's a French version or something. The question mark 
and exclamation are in a different place (which is surprisingly annoying). Also, you can find 
the remedy through kind people who have posted the solution in Amazon, but if you 
have AT&T (maybe others too), you will be unable to send/receive picture messages/texts until you 
do some manual configuration. Once you have the directions, it is super fast and easy, 
but there is no way I would have figured it out on my own!!! Lastly, 
I am sending my second one back today because it simply stopped working. I"m so 
disappointed.
