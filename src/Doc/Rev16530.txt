It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my 
phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the 
call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it 
won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle 
button even if I'm on the home page.
