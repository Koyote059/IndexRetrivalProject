Best phone I have had so far, great performance I am very pleased with this 
purchase. Also great battery life , battery seems to charge very quickly when using the 
correct charger about 30 min on average from 35% level. I have ran multiple emulators 
and am quite impressed with the performance. Dropped this phone once and can not see 
any damage what so ever so the build quality seems to be great. Only a 
small complaint , I ordered the silver model but the actual phone is two tones 
white on the front and silver on the back. Looks like an I phone from 
the front view. I also purchased the BLU VIVO XL and am really happy with 
this phone as well.
