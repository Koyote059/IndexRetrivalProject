It's a good phone, as all Droids are, but the only problem I had is 
pretty much a fatal one: Keyboard dead zone. I could not type 4-6 keys regularly 
in portrait mode (1 at all). Did the generic troubleshooting (battery pull, factory reset, screen 
clean, etc) to no avail. Even purchased a new keyboard app and used a free 
screen tester, which confirmed a dead zone in a column around the "Y" key in 
portrait mode, which explains why unlocking the phone is difficult (I seem to use that 
column to drag down). Hopefully this isn't a recurring problem with most phones, will update 
when replacement from seller comes in the mail.
