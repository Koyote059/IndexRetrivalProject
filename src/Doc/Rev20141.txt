I needed a basic and reliable phone in a hurry and after much research, I 
took a shot on this Nokia C1-01. I'm happy with my choice and I can 
recommend this device to those seeking a similar solution for a cell phone. I don't 
need a smart phone, just something dependable that handles the basics well. By comparison, this 
phone is vastly superior to the Samsung Gravity it replaced, especially in terms of user 
experience.My phone arrived quickly and was in fact unlocked; it worked immediately with my T-mobile 
sim card. It's easy to use, easy to program, and the call quality is fine. 
Battery life is more than acceptable: I leave the phone on 24/7 and charge it 
twice a week at most. A nice bonus is the ability to use Micro SD 
cards for storage and the inclusion of a standard mini-plug input for headphones.This phone is 
well-made and serves its purpose more than adequately. I recommend it.
