This phone is awesome! It made a great first impression when it showed up. I 
could not use it as a phone for a short time, because I did not 
have a micro sim for it. I ordered a micro sim cutter and cut my 
old Straight Talk At&t sim card. It fit perfectly and I got immediate results. The 
cool thing about this is that Straight Talk has no idea I am using this 
instead of my old phone. One issue I have had so far was I couldnt 
figure out how to get the data to work. It ended up being an easy 
fix though, cause all I had to do was modify the APN settings. There are 
a lot of haters out there saying the battery life sucks, but so far it 
has been better than I expected. The phone offers all kinds of options to save 
on battery power. With limited use I could make a full charge last 2-3 days. 
It showed up already set up with Android Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) which is also 
great. I read and watched a lot of reviews on this phone and everyone was 
saying its a great "middle of the road" smartphone, but I say its right up 
there with at least an Iphone 4S. The camera is exactly what I wanted, and 
the dual processor is really quick and smooth. If you are looking to save money 
by using a no contract GSM carrier, this is a great way to go.
