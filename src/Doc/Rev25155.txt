The phone I was given was NOT an unlocked GSM phone. It was a CDMA 
Verizon phone, not a GSM phone, with the original owner's phone number still programmed. Honestly, 
the phone itself is in good condition, but the purpose of me purchasing it was 
so that I could use it abroad with any international SIM card.
