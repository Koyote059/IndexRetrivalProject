The battery cant last even for 12hours. Even when you don't make a call or 
use it for anything. The phone gets hot and I don't know what to do 
with it anymore. I thought that's how sumsung galaxy s4 is made but when I 
asked my friends with the same phone they say it is ok. What is the 
problem with the phone. How can I return it because clearly it seems the phone 
has a problem.
