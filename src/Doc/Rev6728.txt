This was a good phone for the first two months, after that i had more 
problems with this then i did the Blu life pure (which i dropped sadly) if 
i had the money to buy the life pure again i would. it's super slow 
and will no longer charge, i have used different chargers that i know work, and 
my phone won't even respond to the charger. I would go with another choice.
