I am impressed with the quality of this phone,The Xperia Z5 display excellent color reproduction 
and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware 
environment respond quickly and smooth, I have been using continuously and has no overheating by 
the continued use of streaming as z3,The Xperia Z5 is very well put together, with 
Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on 
the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,The camera has truly excellent 
auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone I do not see a big difference compared to 
other phones like Samsung or IPhone S6,but The biggest departure in design terms, is the 
look of the power button. Sonyâs trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for 
years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to 
prevent you accidentally pressing it.I particularly recommend this phone to a friend.
