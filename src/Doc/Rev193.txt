I bought this phone from Marketplace seller "Gotham's Cells." It's the model destined for Taiwan, 
so the phone out of the box was configured in Chinese. You have to go 
into Settings to change the language to, say, English. Unfortunately Android is a pain to 
use, and each version sports a very different UI. This one runs Android 5.I got 
the phone primarily as a sync device for my beloved Sony a6000 camera. Secondarily, I 
use it as a backup phone to my iPhone. Android is very hard to use 
and configure, but this is one of the best Android 5 phones I've tried. It 
runs fast and is very responsive. Sometimes Google's Play Store is really slow but I 
know it's Google's fault, not the phone's, because I'd be on the same WiFi network 
and in the same WiFi range, and the Firefox browser runs fast all the time.If 
you have a Sony mirrorless camera like the alpha series, you need to download two 
apps from the Play Store: PlayMemories Mobile for downloading photos and videos from the camera, 
and (optionally) PlayMemories Online to upload the images to Sony's cloud drive (5GB for free). 
Of course you can forego the latter and sync the photos from the phone to 
your computer; I use a Mac utility Sony provides in addition to auto-syncing to PlayMemories 
Online (cloud storage). I'd have preferred a way to sync to iCloud but so far 
I haven't found a trustworthy way. Android is full of spyware and trojans and viruses, 
and everybody says Google spies on its users, which worries me.Within the confines of being 
an Android phone, this is an excellent smartphone. I recommend it.
