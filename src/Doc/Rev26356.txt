My Nexus 5X got boot failure problem after a half year passed, and I found 
the repair service horrible.It took almost a month to get Nexus 5X back, and it 
didn't mean it was repaired. After the 1st "repair", Boot failure problem was fixed but 
the speaker was completely broken. After the 2nd "repair", It came back without sim tray.If 
you really want to buy Nexus 5X and don't want to spend almost 2 months 
without your phone, I recommend you to buy it with Nexus Protect option from Google 
Store, which would provide immediate replacement.
