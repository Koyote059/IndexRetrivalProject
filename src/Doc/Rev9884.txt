I was able to not give this item/seller any star, I would do it. My 
phone stopped working after two months after I start using it!!... Since it was not 
covered any more under amazon 30 day return policy, I contacted the seller but they 
never answered my emails. I called apple customer service for my one year warranty, I 
made an appointment with apple store and provided them with phone serial number. I was 
shocked when they said that the serial number on the outside is different from the 
one inside the phone, and the original serial number was for a different phone (a 
black phone, non GSM, with 32GB)!! even though I bought it as described (unlocked GSM 
8GB). which means this is FRAUDULENT PHONE!!
