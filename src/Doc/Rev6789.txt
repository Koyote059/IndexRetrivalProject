I bought this phone as a replacement to the one that I had for so 
long. Purchased this one in October 2014. It started acting up around the first part 
of January by making a clicking noise sometimes on the keys. It kept losing signal, 
but it is a 3g, and I live in an area that might lose reception 
on occasion... Then it progressed to changing the colors and font size on the screen. 
Now I am in search of another one because I cannot read my texts coming 
in. The screen is lined and out of sinc. I love this particular kind of 
phone so much that I am looking for another one just like it. I felt 
compelled to write a review because this replacement phone only lasted a little over a 
year before it began to stop working correctly. Yes, even with the problems that I 
have started having with this phone lately, I give it 4 stars.
