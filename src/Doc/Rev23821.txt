Excelent price for a biginner Android smart phone. Relatively low performance phone; not recomended for 
games or a large collection of apps, but is great for basic smartphone use: maps, 
WAZE, move it, facebook, whatsapp, google translate, Email, etc.One problem I've been having since I 
updated the OS is the phone will, about once or twice each week, reboot itself 
and the date and time will go back by a few days and some hours. 
If noticed right away it isn't much of a problem, but if gone unnoticed every 
SMS received will be taged with that date and time making it hard to find 
later.Otherwize a great phone for the price. Works great as a phone to take internationally 
because it will accept any SIM card and can be set to a large veriety 
of languages.
