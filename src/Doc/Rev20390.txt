This is my second Pantech Pursuit purchase (i for me a few years back and 
now this one for my mom as a replacement). The keyboard is easy to use, 
incredibly convenient, and perfectly suited for those of us with small fingers (it's probably a 
bit more difficult for people with large digits). I love the style, the screens are 
clear, the battery life is a bit short but not an issue, and the phone 
does not take pictures well (but that's why I have a camera). I love this 
model and will continue to buy them for as long as I can.
