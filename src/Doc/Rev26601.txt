It worked for me well for the first month and a half then suddenly my 
screen stopped responding only to notie that it was cracked which i found odd since 
i hadnt dropped it or sat on it. I was home alone so no one 
would have cracked it. Probably my last Sony purchase since my other one that I 
had before just blacked out. I would urge you not to buy it.
