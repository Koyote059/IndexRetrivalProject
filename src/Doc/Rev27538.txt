So, my last review said that this phone is wonderful and great and I love 
it..and well I love it but it is slow it disconnects to wifi and connects 
randomly and sends notifications about WiFi randomly and its pretty annoying to be honest, second 
of all I just took my phone off the charger at 100% and looked at 
a snapchat and looked a the percentage and it dropped 10% just like that. This 
phone should be sent with a second battery or a better battery, because some of 
us cant make it to a phone charger with busy life's like me and most 
of everyone out there. This phone is great but these flaws need to be handled 
and this phone would be great, but until then......didnt last me a week, waist of 
money!!!
