This phone seemed to me not to be original... The central button never fit correctly 
the case. It had several issues... I am a person who is used to get 
phones which last at least 2 years... but his phone, OMG... it was a headache... 
I changed it a few months I bought it! By the way, the headphones that 
this phone came with were totally fake and had a horrible quality... I suspect this 
seller does not sell original items!! I would not recommend it!!
