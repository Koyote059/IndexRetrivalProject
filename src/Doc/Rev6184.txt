I mean it's an iPhone. It's easy to use, sleek, syncs with my Macbook Pro, 
and does everything I need it to do. The colors are WAY brighter and more 
vivid than the 4s. It's actually off putting at times. I dread getting a text 
from someone who doesn't use iMessages because the green is SO bright. It's slimmer and 
smaller than the 4s, which is part of the general appeal, but it's taken me 
some getting used to. The camera, both front-facing and back, are way better than the 
4s too. I haven't taken that many pictures but the ones I have were awesome 
(and I took some great ones with my 4s). I feel like there are more 
options to customize on this one than the 4s, too, even though without jailbreaking your 
phone it's still pretty standard Apple stuff. I just shove all the pre-installed apps I 
don't like into a folder and never touch it.
