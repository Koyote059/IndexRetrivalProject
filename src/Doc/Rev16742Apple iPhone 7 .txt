exchanged htc one a9 felt hand good thing definitely didnt want ugly oversized phones popular 
phone sturdy dropped times travelingonce right glass face height 3 feet fell one rough jagged 
granite steps see everywhere india barely scratch last one year iphone 7 picked tiny spots 
back paint come nothing would take away great looks thing survived fair bit abuse without 
phone case hold one longer newer x series phones bulky read get scratched easily everything 
else expected iphone works really well nitpick id say fingerprint reader isnt best market considering 
buying highly recommend
