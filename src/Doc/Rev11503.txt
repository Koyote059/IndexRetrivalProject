I purchased this item when my former SIII started having problems just days before I 
was to leave on vacation. My priority was to have a working phone on vacation, 
so I ordered this and planned for it to be delivered three days before I 
was to leave. The phone was in perfect condition; I popped in my sim card 
from my former SIII, reloaded my apps and app data, and presto! Perfectly functioning phone. 
It's now been 3+ weeks with the new phone, and I've had no problems with 
it.
