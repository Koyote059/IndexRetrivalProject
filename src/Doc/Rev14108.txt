The phone looked in great shape when I received it...however at first I noticed it 
was a bit slower than my previous iPhones. After a couple weeks it was very 
evident the phone was not processing well. Here we are 2 months later and besides 
using it as a phone, everything else is so slow that I cant browse or 
check email unless I have 15 minutes to wait and reopen the application multiple times. 
I am very disappointed in this product
