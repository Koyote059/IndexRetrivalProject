I'm very happy with this new phone. It is fast and very capable. There are 
a few minor annoyances, like I couldn't find any bluetooth settings, but found that turning 
on WHT enabled bluetooth. I also hoped that it had NFS, but it doesn't appear 
to support NFS. I also don't like the placement of the on/off button. It would 
have been better on the top. It's on the right side and I tend to 
squeeze the entire phone with one hand to turn it off and that tends to 
press the volume button on the other side which negates the turn off directive.Still, it's 
very functional, thin, and nice and I would recommend this phone to anyone.
