The keyboard on this phone had several keys that would stick and type multiple letters. 
The company had agreed to replace the phone or refund it, but I accidentally cracked 
the screen before I could return it so I'm stuck with it. That doesn't change 
the fact that the phone was defective when I received it. I purchased this phone 
because I wanted a physical keyboard. Therefore, if the keyboard had been functional, I would 
rate this phone as 4-stars plus.
