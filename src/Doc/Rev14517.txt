We purchased 2 of these phones and we really do love them. Albeit, the price 
dropped since February 2015, but we're okay with that because we really think it's a 
quality phone and warranted the higher-price, based on the extensive research we did. The only 
thing we found disappointing was that the description on Amazon said it would take a 
64 gb sd card, when in fact it would only support a 34 gb card. 
Recently we were delighted that BLU provided an upgrade to the phone, permitting it to 
accept a 64 gb card without any gerryrigging! We're using Straight Talk at $45 mo/5 
gb, unlimited talk and text. Even this is a bonus. Originally it was 3gbs. They've 
increased it to 5gbs if you are using their BYOP plan. Now that it's been 
on the market a few months, they're starting to add accessory products. I just ordered 
a nice leather case that fits the 6.0 LTE version exclusively. I'd like to try 
a selfie stick, but inasmuch as this phone is really a phablet, I'm afraid it 
might be a little too wide for most of the sticks currently available. If anyone's 
purchased a stick that accommodates this phone, please let me know the brand. All in 
all, this phone is beautiful, fast, has great specs, and is reasonably priced. It feels 
great too, not clumsy or heavy.
