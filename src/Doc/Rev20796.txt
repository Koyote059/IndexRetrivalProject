I saw a lot of great reviews about this phone, and I thought I would 
be one of those lucky ones who wrote these great reviews. I was so excited 
to find out that the battery works fine yesterday. Unfortunately, this phone couldn't be activated 
in the store today. It doesn't recognize sim card; maybe it's a locked phone. It's 
been a waste of my time. I just want to break this phone right now, 
but I guess I should get my money back. It's not worth it. I bought 
it from ROSS CELLULAR, btw.
