the phone I actually received was white and not the grey I ordered. The main 
problem I am having so far is the phone won't link up with my Wi-Fi 
and I can't figure out how to clear that setup attempt and reset the phone 
and try again. This is my first smartphone and I have never used Android very 
much. I hope I can figure things out so I don't simply have a costly 
paper weight!
