I'm upset that in less than 10 days the price dropped $50.. I haven't yet 
used the warranty, but I expect I will. I think it's roughly $80 deductible...(Furthermore the 
international version is the one with the fingerprint unlock)In loading my contacts, I find it 
a bit slow.I like the rapid charge.I dislike needing to use headphones for the built-in 
FM Radio feature.I dislike the Yahoo sports inserted in the OSHard to find many cases 
for it.Kernel: 3.10.49 /
