I had bought this to replace my father's old phone which I think was the 
phone that started the line of Samsung Galaxies. Since it's much more modern than the 
one he had there are different things about it, which just make it more awesome. 
It was simple to start up. The only thing that confused me is that is 
has two slot where you can put in a Sim card, and I had mistaken 
it for just one for the Sim card and the other microSD card. The microSD 
card is actually on a slot right on top of on the Sim card slots. 
My father has totally adjusted to his phone, although still learning about some of the 
new functions. I am almost tempted to get one myself. We have AT&T and we 
did not want to add to our bill a phone that back then we could 
of gotten for free. But with this phone, once purchased, is yours until whenever.
