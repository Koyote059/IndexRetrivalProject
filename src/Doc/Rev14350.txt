Blu studio 5.5 D610 was $110 from amazon .This Bu Studio is very easy to 
use i loved it.The quality of this phone is wonderful I had it for 1 
year before i cracked it though. i wish it wasnt so easy to break , 
but other than that it was an awesome phone. Anybody could use this phone it 
was suited for all types of people ( big screen, loud speakers,and even voice command).The 
pros and cons of this phone are quite simple and i dont think i had 
any problems with it.It was well worth the price ipaid for it . If i 
had the money or the chance to buy it all over again i would definitely 
do it again.
