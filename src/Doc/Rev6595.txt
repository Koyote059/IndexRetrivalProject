This is a great band. I've had it a few days and my friend has 
a fitbit charge and she couldn't believe that mine worked just as well as her. 
I used the Dayday band app as suggested. I have an iphone 6plus and it 
works great. Sync automatically over bluetooth. Keep very accurate track, I tested it a few 
times with my friends fitbit charge. Also, the alerts, calls & mms notifications are definitely 
a plus because I don't carry my phone all the time. I would like to 
order more colors.
