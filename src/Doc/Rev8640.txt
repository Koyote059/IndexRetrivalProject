For the goodness of all users/buyers. This phone is using Android 5.1 and has wifi 
intermittent problem among all phone including this one. Wifi would usually disconnect and may connect 
back up even while you are using it. Often it happens to disconnect when wifi 
signal is even in fair condition. It connects/disconnects intermittently. This is known to be the 
problem of Android 5.1 and even 6.*There are lower versons of Adnroid for many phones 
and are known to be very stable. But this phone's wifi is not stable nor 
there is support site for it. Tell me if any knows Orbic official site via 
email to jtecdirect@gmail.comUnless you have a good complementary system (software/support) and options to downgrade, otherwise 
I would not call this is a good product or purchase.
