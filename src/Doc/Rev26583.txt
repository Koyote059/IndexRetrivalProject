I really, really like this phone although I have to stress that I came to 
it from using first a hand-me-down Motorola which was good but pretty outmoded followed by 
a cheapo phone I bought as a temporary replacement when the Motorola failed at a 
critical juncture then kept for more than a year. So far this phone (which I 
brought at a substantial discount on Prime Day and which has been supplanted by at 
least two newer versions) has lived up to everything I expect of a smartphone. I 
have it loaded with apps and it hasn't slowed down in the least from its 
factory condition. The sound clarity is good; the screen is clear, the settings are easy 
to use. I get excellent service even in a remote beach area I patrol regularly 
and where I previously was always nearly barless.My only complaint is the battery which seems 
to plummet after reaching an indication of 50% - have already drained it more than 
I want to think about. Second, and this may be unique to my set - 
is that no charger I have been able to find fits securely in the port. 
I will plug it in to charge at bedtime and wake to find it completely 
drained - apparently a butterfly had passed by and dislodged the cable. Other than the 
charging and draining problems this phone deserves five stars, especially at under $100.
