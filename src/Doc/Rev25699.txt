Efficient and great price. It is smaller than I expected it to be, but it 
is perfect for my needs: I am planning on traveling to two european countries this 
summer and I will get two sim cards. I already put one card on (Spain's) 
and it works perfect. It may not take the best pictures with the secondary camera, 
but it will get the job done in an emergency. :)It also has gps, and 
hot-spot wifi, which I was very interested in getting just in case the need arises.Other 
reviewers have mentioned that the memory is pretty low. I purchased an 8GB SD Card 
and now it has more memory for music and pictures.Mine came with the US plug 
charger, and earphones. The instructions though are in a different language, except the very basic 
ones that come in English as well.
