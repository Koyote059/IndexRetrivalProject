Very reliable. Very user friendly , you can download skyfire and watch video with flash. 
The middle button works like a mouse and the ovi maps work great.It comes in 
handy when you are somewhere and you don't have a gps. It will give you 
a sense of security. There is nothing on the market that has that much function 
and still made out of stainless steel and its super thin. Only bad thing is 
that it doesn't have touchscreen, but oh well for what it is its a great 
phone. I recommend this phone.
