Love love love my phone!!!!! Not one problem better then any phone iv had (and 
iv had tons) from iphones to BlackBerrys to Galaxy's to Palm's and the list can 
go on but this phone by far one of the best most simple straight forward 
phones out their, I live in Canada but ordered it of the American store came 
in 3 days no problems activating no problems with battery life,sim cards or memory cards 
they all work perfectly...I was kind of hesitant at first but figure for the price 
I couldn't loose if it wouldn't work as a phone I could give it to 
my 8 year old to use as a tablet but so far so good phablet/tablet 
it all works great
