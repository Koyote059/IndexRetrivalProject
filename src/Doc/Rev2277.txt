I love the Samsung Strive but you guys sent me a defective one which ! 
returned. The sad thing about it is that I purchased it with the sole intention 
of transferring my pictures and videos from the old samsung strive to the new one. 
AT&T assisted me with this undertaking.What happened was that because the phone had a defect, 
years and years worth of pictures and videos were lost. I have not been able 
to retrieve them at all. I am so broken hearted over this because they were 
pictures and videos I had intended to put on a DVD for the sake of 
preserving history. Now they are gone and my phone is gone. But I love the 
Samsung Strive more than anyother phone I have ever used. Would love to have another 
one. Amazon should replace my phone free of charge, for sending me a defective phone 
and for it losing my precious photo and video treasures. They are irreplaceable...In addition, the 
phone you sent was supposed to be new, at least that is what I was 
told over the phone but when I received it, it clearly stated on the box 
that it had been refurbishedApparently, the quality control inspector missed this one!!!! Does Amazon HAVE 
a Quality Control Inspector? All I know is that this was my very first order 
with Amazon but now am reluctant to order anything else and I really need that 
SAMSUNG STRIVEOne that is not defective. The Samsung Strive is the phone I know and 
am the most comfortable with. I have a disability and this phone works best for 
me. I have tried other phones but nothing compares to the Samsung Strive. Please send 
me another one. But please have someone check it out before you send it to 
make sure IT isn't defective too. Do the "RIGHT" thing and foot the bill it 
is only fair. I'm lost without that phone...There are other products I want to order 
but again, am hesitant. You do right by me on this and I may reconsider.Thank 
you,Sheryl A. SaltsmanP.S.Thank you very much. ! do not wish to be a celebrity ANYTHING!!!! 
I just want a phone. THAT WORKS RIGHT!!!!
