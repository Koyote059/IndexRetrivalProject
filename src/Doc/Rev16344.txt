the phone worked. I DONT UNDERSTAND THE DUAL SIM CARD WHICH WAS A TRUE PAIN.i 
was trying to use straight talk. the screen when i typed looked liked it was 
cracked ujnderneath though you couldn't see the crack. touch was aweful. shipping was fast and 
here in two days. the phone is huge. it's like holding a tablet to your 
face to talk on it. i mean really? I was very dissapoinjted with this. and 
the bad thing is i didn't mean to order it! lol..... but i was excited 
to have a new phone. just save your time and money and go with a 
real samsung this is a knock off. and not labeled.
