I've had the phone for a few weeks and it accomplishes the basics - calls, 
texting, browsing. I do enjoy the familiarity of a Windows operating system, but I can't 
imagine attempting to write documents on a small screen. Unfortunately, I found out too late 
- it's not on Microsoft's list of upgrades to Windows 10 (not even a Windows 
Insider Preview). Which leaves me with a scarce amount of apps to use). The dual 
facing camera is nothing out of the ordinary, but there are a few sweet apps 
to make shooting pics entertaining. The simplest feature I enjoy...easily locating apps in alphabetical order!
