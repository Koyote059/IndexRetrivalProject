Everything was perfect with the delivery. The cell phone was brand new and everything was 
great. I just do not like some features of the phone: I donât like how 
it is very hard to figure out that you have a voice mail â the 
little number that show voice mail is very small and hardly visible. I donât like 
how all the calls are listed separately, does not stuck the calls from the same 
phone number. Overall it is a good phone. I donât pay for internet, so I 
am happy with the Wi-Fi option.
