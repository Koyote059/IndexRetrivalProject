Replaced the wife's aging Sony Xperia J with this. Good phone - extremely lightweight. Family 
owns several other BLU's; all have proven good value for money - no problems with 
any of them. Reasonably fast; smooth interface, not much (if any) bloatware - good camera, 
good display. Not for moronic phone snobs. She's a heavy texter, uses it as her 
primary navigation device; takes pictures and videos with it. Occasionally she even uses it as 
a phone.UPDATE: I see some reviews up here from folks having trouble installing/reading an SD 
card, installing/moving apps, bad displays, etc. This phone runs flawlessly. It should certainly recognize/read a 
32GB SD card, and allow you to move apps off to that card. I have 
noted NO screen/display anomalies (it's actually a pretty nice display), and this phone, in spite 
of my wife running about 13 apps at the same time - runs fine! We're 
on AT$T and it runs 4G. The Bluetooth interface works well in the car, Google 
Maps and/or Here Navi work fine, etc - in short - I'd have to opine 
if you have trouble with this phone send it back immediately - because there are 
no native (that I can find) faults/defects.And yes, of course, we have iphone6's, Samsung galaxies, 
etc.
