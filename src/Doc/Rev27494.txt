There really isn't anything like it available for purchase at this time. This phone is 
exactly what the iPhone users are hanging onto, a sub 5 inch phone with competitive 
specs. The 720p resolution is totally fine for the size of the screen. If you 
feel like it is a big sacrifice, just remember it improves the battery life (up 
to 2 days). The camera is pretty amazing and the expandable memory (micro sd) is 
also a breath of fresh air coming from an iPhone. If you want the freedom 
of Android and a reasonably priced phone (unlike the iPhone), then do not hesitate, BUY 
IT!
