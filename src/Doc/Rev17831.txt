Wow...just love it. I want to cuddle with it at night. octocore is fast. design 
is sleek. display is crisp. camera is good. OS is solid. I've had it for 
two weeks. If it breaks next month, I can still order another one and still 
be ahead when it comes to value vs a samsung. But so far I'm more 
than happy with it. I'm an advanced user.
