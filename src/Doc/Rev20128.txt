I decided to purchase this phone as an upgrade for the straight talk lg optimus 
fuel I was using.I was impressed when I got the phone,it has a nice big 
screen high quality display, the sound quality is amazing except during phone calls if your 
not using the earphones,the picture quality is unbelievable and simple,setup is simple and straight forward.The 
battery seems to drain kind of fast if using internet,and for some reason the phone 
heats up in the top right back of the phone.I have had my phone a 
few weeks now after the initial setup with straight talk which was a bit of 
a challenge my phone is working perfectly I'm happy I went with this phone it 
has been the best phone I have purchased I would definitely buy again.
