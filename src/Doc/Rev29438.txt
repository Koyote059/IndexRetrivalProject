I purchased this plan because I do not want a data plan and many of 
the other models require a data plan. I did not want to increase my plan 
cost and this phone allows me to keep my current no data plan. The key 
board is convenient, phone is sturdy and durable, strong signal, decent features. A good buy 
and decent phone if you do not want a data plan.
