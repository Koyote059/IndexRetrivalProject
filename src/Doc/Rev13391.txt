This cell phone looks nice, it's very light, good screen size for videos, pictures, etc.Set-up 
was very easy and migrating all all contacts from previous cell phone was a breeze.camera 
app included is really bad.. terrible resolution even blurry pictures, this phone is ok for 
the price for an android phone if you don't want a contract.. if you don't 
mind the contract.. go with a different phone.. perhaps an iPhone, a newer version of 
the Samsung Galaxy.
