I have never enjoyed a phone as much as I have this one.I buy phones 
and use them for as long as possible, so I have only had a few 
phones in my life.I actually expect this one to last a few years. I like 
how quick it is as a device.I like the antenna and amplification.I love that it 
has a HUGE battery life, 10.78Wh..... TEN-POINT-SEVEN-EIGHT! STOCK!I don't like how some Samsung software works.... 
and that happens to be on the phone..... but that has little to do with 
the device itself
