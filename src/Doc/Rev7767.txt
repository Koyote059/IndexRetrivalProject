You can't play Angry Birds or update your Facebook status, but this phone let's you 
do what a phone is supposed to, call your wife.I love this phone, which is 
actually known as the Avatar ET-1. After ordering it on Amazon from Victor International, it 
arrived in a few days (which was an extremely pleasant suprise)I put in my prepaid 
T-Mobile SIM card and the phone worked instantly (which was another pleasant suprise).It does everything 
I had hoped for, which is: Make calls, while not having to carry a phone 
in my pocket or belt.A little background on why I bought this phone:I love technology, 
but never got into the whole carrying a phone thing, especially now-a-days with phones like 
the iPhone (with are pretty big if you think about it). If I wanted to 
surf the web, I could do it at home on my Ipad or Laptop. I 
had never felt the desire to pay $50+ a month for a internet plan or 
$50+ for a cell phone plan (which could add up to over $1000 a year). 
For the last few years, I have been using a T-mobile prepaid plan, and last 
year only paid $5 for my prepaid plan (so I could keep my minutes). But...because 
I hate carrying a phone, my wife would get upset with me because she could 
never reach me, and there were times I had wished I had a phone handy 
to make a quick call. So, I decided to surf the web (from my laptop) 
to see if there was a wrist cell phone. I looked all over, and felt 
this was the phone that best suited me. One of the major reasons I bought 
this one instead of other wrist phones was that it had buttons for dialing (not 
just touchscreen). I didn't want to pull out a stylus everytime I wanted to make 
a call. To be honest, I also love the movie Avatar, and figured James Cameron 
wouldn't lend his movie's name to just any watch.Calling is easy, but it took a 
day or so to figure out how to navigate quickly, upload my ringtone MP3's (from 
a micro SD card) and enter my phone numbers. The touchscreen works, but I prefer 
using buttons to navigate. I still haven't tried out the MP3 player, and I plan 
on testing out the Bluetooth when I have time.In closing, I finally feel I have 
a phone that is cool and practical. I feel like I'm on Star Trek, when 
I make calls now. You should see the reactions I get from people (from high 
schoolers to grandparents). They are amazed that it works so well. They also comment on 
how much more sense it is to have a phone readily available, rather than digging 
into their pocket to answer a call.Gotta go, my wife is calling :)
