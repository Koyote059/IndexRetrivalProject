Purchased from Bobcat Wireless and received a great Refurbished phone. Came in generic packaging, but 
had an Apple charger. Setup was tricky at Verizon but the dude got it done. 
This phone is basically an iphone 5 in Color...which is what the C stands for. 
It does not have Fingerprint Sensor or some of the added camera specs of the 
5s, but for normal, daytime pix, this phone is great. The exterior is a tough 
plastic exterior around aluminum. The size is nice. If you are like me and can't 
stand the thought of holding a tablet to your ear, you will like the size 
and feel of this phone. The color is great. I bought this for my son, 
but honestly, I had a hard time handing it over. The green phone is a 
tad lighter than standard Minecraft green. Fellow geeks will understand. I went with 32GB. I 
don't recommend going with anything less unless you have the restraint to use only a 
handful of apps. I wish this phone had offered the 64GB option. This phone is 
fast. It moves seamlessly from songs to apps, etc. Apparently you have to set Siri 
up on this phone. I'll deal with that another day. But, very satisfied with this 
seller and phone. The phone did work with Verizon, although unlocked. And, the iCloud and 
iTunes information from the previous owner was completely deleted.
