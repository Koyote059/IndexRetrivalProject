I would write this on the seller as they sold me a cellphone as new 
and it is clear that this is used. The alarm option had two alarms set 
in there. Also the phone itself functions poorly. Very often when i make a phone 
call or a phone call comes in I cannot hear anything. The battery life is 
very short also showing that this is used. I don't use this phone heavily and 
at the end of the day there is almost no battery life left. (after recharging 
it through the night)
