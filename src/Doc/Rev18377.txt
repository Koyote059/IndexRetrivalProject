I am very impressed that you can buy a phone of this quality and with 
these specifications for under $100 at the time of writing this review. The phone feels 
comfortable in hand and not too bulky, I was still able to operate most functions 
of the phone with one handed. The phone has a good weight and has great 
quality of the screen. The technical specs are: 5.5-inch touchscreen with IPS HD display, 1280x720 
pixels resolution. Besides all that technical stuff I can tell you that the screen is 
amazing, the colors are rich and vibrant and onscreen texts look crisp and sharp, very 
impressed. The brains of the phone are a Mediatek 6580 Quad Core 1.3 GHz Processor 
with arm Mali-400 GPU running on 5.1 lollipop. I was able to navigate apps and 
games quickly, even with multiple apps open the phone. No problem watching HD movies or 
playing few games I tested, the phone have 5.0mp for rear camera and 0.3 mp 
front camera. The camera features HDR, Anti-Shake and other camera options. With a little adjustment 
on the setting the photos were crisp and clear as were the videos, the sound 
quality is very acceptable in this price range, it is certainly loud enough to hear 
calls and notifications. The phone comes with 2800mAh Li-ion battery. Included with the phone you 
also receive a clear protective case and a screen protector already applied. Overall i can't 
recommend this phone enough if you are on a budget but good quality smartphone then 
look no further. I would highly recommend. ** sample was provided for review and test
