This phone is a high quality phone, however in due time it will be rendered 
obsolete. I only use it for Development. And, it's been rated in the top 10 
on many other SmartPhone review websites. It was delivered with excellent packaging and a manual 
and extra protection on the screen and backside. If you plan on developing for the 
Windows Phone which has less than 2 percent of the entire phone market, then this 
cost-efficient phone is the one to get. Besides, with the popularity of the Iphone4s you 
may want to concentrate on iOS until the Windows Phone becomes worthy of Indie development. 
lolIn other words, the phone is great, however the OS is not quite ready to 
compete with Android or iOS at this point in terms of popularity. :)
