I like the slider for texting and that the keys are not too tiny for 
me to use comfortably. The phone is small enough to fit in my pocket and 
the screen is larger than on my prior phone. I miss the "clamshell" prior phone 
because it protected its screen, but I bought screen protectors and have to lock the 
keyboard to carry the "slider" phone in my pocket. Fun phone and much easier to 
text than the "clamshell"!UPDATE: After a month of use, I have noticed the reception sometimes 
goes away at night and the screen keeps "searching" for the signal hours, sometimes until 
mid morning the next day! Otherwise I liked this phone. Have now switched back to 
a Motorola Tundra for a stronger signal, minus the easier texting. Evergreen was good though, 
if not for poor reception! Both the Motorola Razor and Motorola Tundra have had a 
very strong signal at the same time the Evergreen would have little or none! I 
gave up on Evergreen.
