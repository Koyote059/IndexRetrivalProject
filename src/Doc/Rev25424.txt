My husband has been using an iphone 4 for years because he didn't want to 
upgrade to a big phone, which a lot of the cool phones are nowadays. AT&T 
here doesn't carry this phone yet. Surprised him with this and it's perfect! He absolutely 
loves this phone. It's sleek, lightweight, almost the same size as his old iphone. Perfect 
for a guy who doesn't want a ipad sized phone. LOL It did come in 
French but was pretty easy to change the language. It works on AT&T's H+ (?) 
network. Doesn't work with LTE but internet is fast enough. Way better than what the 
Iphone 4 was getting. Best part of this is no more Itunes!
