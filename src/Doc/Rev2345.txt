Card arrived as promised. Had to spend time on the phone with Verizon getting it 
activated, rebooting phone, etc.because I couldn't text, phone said I was roaming. When I try 
to do a video it says "Not able to capture media. Not enough memory available." 
Never had this problem with old SIM card.
