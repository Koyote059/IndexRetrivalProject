Bought this phones as a replacement of my stolen phone while in Walmart...I didn't replace 
it with a newer version because I consider the LG G3 way better then the 
LG G4 and the newer G5 was to expensive to purchase through the insurance cover....This 
is a fantastic phone from the speed and facilities it offers and the camera to 
the internet...It's the Korean version which has the duel sim and was perfect for me...One 
sim to use as a phone call and texts and the other sim for Data 
on 4G...The screen resolution is outstanding and ability to shoot 4K video is the icing 
on the cake..Everyone comments on the quality of my photos and video clips and they 
are surprised that what they see was taken on the phone itself. In my opinion 
this LG G3 is way in front of Samsung or an iphone which Americans seems 
to think is the only companies out there ...Believe me when I say ...LG is 
way better as an all rounder...don't be fooled into thinking there are only 2 companies 
that make great Smart phones...I'm not going into any more details about this fantastic smart 
phone...just go and try one for yourself...You'll be impressed.
