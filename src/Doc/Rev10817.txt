The phone is AWESOME, but it was NOT unlocked. I bought in the states, moved 
to Dubai and it wouldn't work. I had to go to a Samsung office and 
have it sent out to get unlocked. Cost about $20 and 4 days. Transitioning to 
the UAE is difficult enough. This was a pain in the butt. You NEED a 
mobile phone to survive here. It's used for EVERYTHING.
