Before purchasing this phone I did my research, read and listened to a lot of 
reviews and compared it with other phones. From my research I knew the camera would 
be a bit of an issue but going from a blackberry with a 2mp camera 
to this phone I really can't complain. I also thought the phone would be a 
bit too large but I was so wrong. The phone feels perfect in the palm 
of my hands. I have had it since the beginning of March and it is 
working perfectly.Pros:The call quality is great.Lots of apps to choose fromThe phone is lightweight and 
comfortable (it feels a lot more comfy with the plastic case so I always keep 
it on)Dual sim capability is great (especially when you live in a country where most 
persons have two cell phones)It has fallen a few times and I have no idea 
how it did not break, so it is stronger than it looks.Cons:Although the sound from 
the headphones is loud and clear they are the "in ear" headphones which I can't 
use as they don't stay in my ears. I have tried two other headphones but 
they don't work in this phone.The camera quality of the front facing camera is not 
perfect (sometimes gets grainy) but it is less megapixels than the back camera. The pictures 
come out great in good lighting though.Don't forget to purchase an adequate size sd card 
when buying this if you don't already have one.
