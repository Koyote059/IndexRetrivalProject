I don't understand how you can sell something as new when you have obviously opened 
and installed programs on it. This phones homepage was bbs. romup . com and there 
is a root explore app installed. As well as a card tucked inside that says 
if I give POSITIVE feedback in the next 7 days I get my warranty extended 
to 45 days.My husbands black one appears fine.
