It's a heck of a phone. Fast, small and updatable. The ugly things I didn't 
like is that first time configuration can be a little frustrating and that mine came 
with the message app malfunctioning son I went in the Internet and searched for this 
problem and I found out I wasn't the only one with it. There was people 
with the same problem even at lg's Web page an the solution for all was 
downloading an alternative msging app from Google play store. This is nothing to worry about 
since the app looks very original and it has no publicity pop-ups or things that 
bother. I'm just waiting for my courier to come out of package congestion to buy 
this phone again for my wife(im from outside the US). Don't hesitate in buying this 
phone to me it's a good one.I used to hate LG since I bought the 
LG Chocolate years ago (that's how they call it here), I was disappointed an never 
tried the brand again till now and I have to say it. They have digged 
themselves out of the hole.
