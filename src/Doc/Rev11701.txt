I bought this phone in August for my wife, the phone has been a hassle 
from the get go. Two weeks after purchase the volume button started moving erratically on 
its own. Then the phone started hanging and will not reset by just switching off 
the phone, we need to hold the power button and the decrease volume button at 
the same time. The frequency of hanging just kept increasing, even after the doing a 
factory reset the phone continued to deteriorate. I am highly disappointed! I would have returned 
the phone if the window had not elapsed. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!
