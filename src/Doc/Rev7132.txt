Not even a one! Awful product! Will not send or receive messages on time. Will 
send and receive then no utes to hours later. Slow with internet and apps. Doesnt 
support my computer so I'm unable to get files on or off the device. W/o 
register that an email has been opened and deleted, same with text, either won't register 
they are there or won't register they have been opened. When it done send they 
will send multiple times. Keyboard is slow, phone dies quickly.Overall a bad phone. Says it's 
new but clearly refurbished. Would have been nett to spend the $600 on a new 
iPhone which I plan to do soon.
