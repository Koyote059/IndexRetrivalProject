The phone was unlocked but was formerly a Sprint serviced phone. It turned out to 
be a stolen product and Sprint was able to disable the voice and messaging functions. 
However Amazon did back it up with a refund for me. Next, I bought the 
same phone but used, not refurbished, with a different service provider, thru Amazon. It has 
my carrier on it (t-mobile) and have had no issues with it. It is also 
unlocked.Great camera. Except it gets fuzzy at max zoom.
