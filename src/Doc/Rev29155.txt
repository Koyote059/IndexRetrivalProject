The phone matches my expectations. I researched a lot before buying it, and I'm happy 
with it!At first, I was surprised because it came with Italian factory settings (language and 
manual), but it was easy to change to my language.The battery life is satisfactory. If 
used mostly of the day with functions Wi-Fi and GPS on, the cell phone lasts 
for approximately a day and half without recharging. Without these functions, it lasts about three 
days.Windows 8 is easy and fun to use, although it has fewer applications available in 
their store than Android.The camera has a great quality compared to the standard camera phones.For 
me, a great quality of the phone is its GPS. Nokia Maps with its function 
to work offline is perfect, and the location occurs rapidly. Nokia Drive works as a 
perfect automotive GPS with voice options in several languagesââ.In summary, I'm happy with the phone 
and I recommend it!
