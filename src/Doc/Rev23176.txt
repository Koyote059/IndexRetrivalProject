Very user friendly, and quality durable case and high defination screen. Very comparable to an 
I-phone without the cost. Been using the phone for every day use and have not 
had any problems. Three months. Use the phone in high heat and humidity, and have 
not experienced any problems. The apps are good, speed, and the phone can stay charged 
for up to 4 days without charging with normal use. I am so rough on 
phones I do keep mine in a camera case due to lots of heavy bumpy 
items in my backpack. Sorry to hear about the poor customer service from BLU. I 
love this phone and many of my associates are amazed at the price and quality.
