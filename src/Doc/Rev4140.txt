Honestly so far I really am pleased with it. I still am not sure about 
everything it does and I get confused. But that's because Inc not the best with 
technology. It did come in a box that wasn't the original but it looked similar. 
Very good condition, no scratches or dings. It was indeed the 42mm Watch face and 
it came with a white band. Over all I am happy and new it would 
have cost me $349. So I saved over $100. I'm happy!
