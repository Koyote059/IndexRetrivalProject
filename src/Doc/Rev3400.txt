This product for the price it's going at is very good surprisingly. The build of 
it feels very nice and has good weight to it as does the apple watch. 
It sucks that the screen isn't HD, but, then again nothing under $100 on a 
smartwatch does, at least to my knowledge. The strap feels good in the hands and 
can probably last you a couple months, or years, depending on how well you take 
care of it!
