This phone was delivered to me on March 9, 2016 so it 8 days now 
since I have been using it. My experience so far is great in terms of 
the function of the phone. I first had the BLU Studio 7.0 II which I 
liked because of the size, but had to change to this one as it has 
more memory (16gb) which enabled my apps to update automatically without a problem. Blu Studio 
7.0 LTE is the only BLU that comes closest in size to 7.0 II. The 
BLU company needs to make those 7.0 big display phones with much more memory.In addition, 
I find some features of BLU Studio 7.0 to be boring. for example, I would 
like to make the wallpaper for my SMS colorful than it is, and that feature 
is not available. For that I only gave 4 stars. The battery life is pretty 
long. It last at least 11 hours with heavy use of internet.I will update as 
time goes by.
