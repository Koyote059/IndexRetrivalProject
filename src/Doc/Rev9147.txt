Probably the lousiest phone I've ever owned. My son's phone died but we weren't due 
for an upgrade on his line for over a year so I purchased this one 
as a bandaid. Know what? A bandaid probably would have functioned better as a phone, 
than this phone did.The touch/swipe interface was MISERABLE - you had to press or swipe 
so hard just to get the thing to answer a call or change functions/menu screens.It 
wouldn't hold a charge for nothin'! Even in my son's backpack while at school, ie 
not being used, it would be dead by 2nd period.It turned itself off at will, 
and sometimes at a most inopportune time!Every 3 weeks or so, this little peach of 
a phone decided to wipe out all the contacts and stored messages/media. You'd pick it 
up to make a call, and realize that everything was GONE. It did this more 
times than I could keep count of.Obviousy, this phone did NOT serve us even mildly 
well, which was a shock to me for a Samsung. I've always liked their products 
and we have Samsungs all around right now that we love. But this one? Sorry 
to say, it's a total dud. We laid the smackdown on it after only a 
few months, when we just couldn't take its miserable antics anymore!
