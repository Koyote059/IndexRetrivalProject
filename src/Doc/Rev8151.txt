I had this phone for a month now through StraightTalk's bring your own phone plan. 
Everything works amazing and I have no problems with it. No 4G but that does 
not bother me because the 3G works amazing and only paying $45 a month for 
unlimited everything with a phone like this, why should I be picky about a little 
bit faster speed. Phone is great, if youre on the fence about buying this, BUY 
IT! its worth it!Pros:-Works with Straight Talk Bring Your Own Phone $45 Unlimited Everything Plan. 
And works like a charm with fast speed!-Water proof (and beer proof too =D)-Amazing Camera-Good 
speaker-Use my PS3 controller with it-Use the PSP Emulator on HD graphics setting with no 
lag. Amazing for a phone!-Screen looks crystal clear (sometimes I watch Hulu and Netflix and 
the phone instead of my TV)-Feels like a premium phone and not something with plastic 
built-Xperia Rom is an amazing home screen.Cons:-No 4G (but not that big of a deal)-When 
I first put my 64GB Micro SD card in, it deleted everything without promting me 
to format. I had to get all my music back.-Sometimes my widgets stop working. Have 
to reboot the phone. Only happens about once every one to two weeks-Compare to the 
Galaxy S3 the sound quality for music output is ehhhh. (but still not bad)
