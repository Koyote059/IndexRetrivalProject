This is a great phone, but until it begin to have serious issues. A couple 
months after I bought it, I had issues with the battery it started to turn 
off suddenly at 50% of the charge and when charging it overheat. Then Amazon replaced 
my phone (BTW, a great job from this AMAZing team), and I was enjoying the 
phone until a couple weeks when the NEW phone started to have serious issues. It 
suddenly has touchs at the phone, doing things by itself, it seems to be something 
related to the display, but the phone has less than a year of usage!!!! This 
really surprised me, I lost a lot of information and I can't use the phone 
for browsing the web of Facebook, just to answer calls. Even writing a msg is 
a mess because there are several touchs at the screens and it writes whatever word. 
I then contacted Amazon and at the beginning the response was 30 days period was 
past and no action can be done, I asked for an escalation and the team 
is now working with the manufacturer. BTW, I contacted the manufacturer and they suggested a 
test that failed, and now they are asking me to send the phone to the 
US to be repaired, but I asked them to know what happen if the phone 
is no longer useful, who will response for it? No answer yet. My money counts!!! 
So I'm counting with Amazon support with the manufacturer, until that my review will be
