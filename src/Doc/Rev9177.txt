I bought the phone. It arrived on time. The phone has a T-mobile logo on 
it. I placed my ATT SIM card with data plan in the phone but could 
not pass the google activation. The error message is "can not find network". I borrowed 
a T-mobile SIM card with data plan from a friend. Then I could finish the 
google activation. Swapped back to my ATT SIM card, I could make a phone call, 
but still could not use 3G service. Browsed on Internet, got following info "AT$T 3G 
network works on 850/1900 MHz bands. The myTouch 3G is only compatible with the 900/1700/2100 
MHz 3G bands which means it will work with T-Mobile's 1700/2100 3G network. and the 
european 900/2100Mhz 3G network. But not AT$T." So I returned the phone.
