After a few months using this phone, I realized THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL brand 
new Samsung!!After 3 months using it, the phone was not able not connect to the 
computer. It was never recognized. I took it to technical service... and what a SURPRISE: 
The battery that this phone came with was F A K E!! (I dont even 
know if other parts of the phone were fake as well)... After some days, I 
realized all the items my phone came with (USB cable, charger) were not original either!I 
am truly dissappointed. and please DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER if you want to 
get original devices!! I have been using my phone less than a year and it 
came up with several issues, I have spent already half of its price only on 
technical services + buying original accesories for it!!
