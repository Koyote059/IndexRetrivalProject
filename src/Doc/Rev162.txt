I just got this phone in the mail today as a replacement for another slider. 
I bought this brand new and it's great. I'm able to put all of my 
android apps on here and watch you tube and it connects to WiFi hot spots 
in just a couple of seconds and is good functioning. Some people said that the 
battery life was short but I haven't experienced battery problems. Might be because I bought 
everything new. When I use the slider the screen switches over really fast to type 
mode, that I do like. Some sliders freeze when being switched to keyboard mode. I 
recommend this phone it's great. I will give another update in a few weeks.4.16.15 Update: 
This phone is still awesome and it does everything I need it to. I adjusted 
all of the energy settings and it's awesome. It has a cool texting to calling 
option; I can be texting and swipe over the persons name in my inbox and 
it calls them. I would say the only thing that runs the battery down at 
all is lots of lengthy phone calls or lengthy app use. But the energy settings 
change this a lot. I enjoy this phone still and I recommend it to anyone 
who likes the slider feature with a few gadgets to play along side the call 
and text part. Also I bought this phone already unlocked to use for my tmobile 
plan and it came as such.
