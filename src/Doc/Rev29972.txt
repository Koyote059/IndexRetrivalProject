I absolutely LOVE this phone, the cameras are stunning. such sharp image, it honestly makes 
me feel like a photographer. Its definitely worth the price and theres a lot of 
cool features. the only thing I don't like is that the windows store doesn't have 
snapchat :( but the phones totally worth it. the only problem I really had was 
having to set up my family but once you do everything is fine.
