My daily phone is a Samsung Note 4, but I decided to buy this as 
a back up phone and for times when I didn't want to worry about having 
an $800 cell phone with me. I'm using this phone on T-Mobile and, considering the 
price, it's fantastic. The screen is very nice and detailed, radio reception of lte is 
good, phone sound quality is good and it runs without lag or being too slow. 
To be honest, after all the junk that Samsung adds to Android it is a 
pleasure to use Motorola's version which is almost as lean as a Nexus phone. Unless 
you download hundreds of apps or play very graphic extensive games this phone does everything 
that almost anyone could want with all day battery life at a very modest cost. 
The Note 4 has better battery life, a more detailed screen and a lot of 
options like a heart rate monitor that this phone doesn't want, but at 1/4 the 
cost the G LTE is a bargain. It is the first low cost phone that 
I have ever used that I would be glad to use on an every day 
basis.
