I've had my phone for about 3 months now and so far I love it. 
It was almost exactly as advertised. There are only a few issues with it, but 
I have been able to overcome them. The charger that came with it was a 
joke. It charged so slow and then it developed a short in it somewhere. Went 
out and bought a new one and no more problems that way. It didn't come 
with a case, which had been advertised elsewhere, but no big deal. The camera isn't 
great, but I don't really use the camera for anything important. It is fast and 
does everything I need it to do.
