Overall I like this phone. I've had a Nokia 520 GoPhone with AT&T. I've have 
an Android phone as well, but I prefer the Windows Phone 10 OS. The size 
of the phone is what I was looking for and I'm very pleased. I like 
the clear case that came with it. For a lower end phone, the speaker is 
acceptable. The 8MP camera is a weak, but I'm not a person that takes 100s 
of photos a week. It's fine for taking pics as reminders and such.
