This phone looks like the original but in fact was a cheap plastic model, not 
metal like the originals, which was powered by a below standard battery with low usage 
time available. It works but when I noticed the spelling on the setup for my 
PERSONALIZE (their spelling PERSONALISE) settings I knew I was in for other disappointments. Apparently the 
"M" on the phone does not mean it is really an original Motorola Phone.
