For $20, this is a great starter phone for my son. It's fairly easy to 
figure out, which is a good thing, because it's definitely not as straight forward as 
your high end phone. When the battery isn't in it, you can feel how cheap 
it's made, but again, for a basic phone, it serves it's purpose well. The only 
downside, is it does not have T9 text input, so it's more difficult to type 
messages.
