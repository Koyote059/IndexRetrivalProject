The phone was in great physical condition when I received it. It had very little 
wear on it. About a week after using the phone, I could not get it 
to charge or even turn on. I did some troubleshooting such as buying a new 
charger to no avail. So I brought it in to my local Sprint store to 
find out it had a one year warranty. I was delighted! I brought it to 
the apple store and they said the phone was defective. They swapped the defective.phone for 
a brand new iphone 5s. I would definitely buy from this person again.
