For starters, I love the Nokia product. I've tried other brands of cell phones and 
have kept coming back to Nokia. The Mural 6750 is quick and easy to learn 
with simple steps to get to menus. I love the calendar function as well as 
the To-Do function!!I love the fact that when I've missed a call or text, the 
phone color fades in and out! When I walked into the store to get my 
old one replaced (after 3 years, the speaker went out), the employees laughed and said 
it wasn't made anymore & tried to talk me into a SmartPhone. I'm not dumb 
but I didn't want or need (nor wanted to pay extra for a data package) 
a phone that is smarter than I am.I walked out of there with a different 
type of flip phone and couldn't stand it. I ended up on Amazon & purchased 
another Mural!! I just hope that when this one takes a dive, I can still 
get another one!!
