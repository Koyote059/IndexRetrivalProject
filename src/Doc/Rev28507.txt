I would have rated this phone a 5 if not for only one issue; it 
takes about 18hrs to charge complete every time the battery is dead. If you are 
thinking about buying this phone, you should consider buying one or two extra batteries pluse 
a cellphone battery charger so you can avoid beining tied down waiting 18hrs for your 
phone to finish charge. For those who cannot afford an Iphone 4 or samsung galaxy 
get a pantach they are just as good.
