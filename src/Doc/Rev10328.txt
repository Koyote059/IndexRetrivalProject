This phone compared to my older Samsung Rugby Smart, is lightening fast on the internet 
and it's internal programming, has great voice recognition, far more sophisticated, yet easier to learn 
and operate i.e. 'user friendly'. The larger screen is a delightful to see graphics and 
videos and the volume is loud enough to be heard easily. It seems to adjust 
automatically to outside light and the display is visible in all light conditions. I have 
not seen an I-Phone or Samsung that matches it. This brand is a real sleeper 
in it's class and is less than half the price of comparable phones.. No wonder 
Consumer Cellular offers it. Even though it's a large phone, I can still keep it 
in my left hand front pocket in my jeans or trousers.
