This LG smartphone is their current flagship and runs on Android 4.0.3 (ICS)+cheap in comparison 
to the other flagships like ONE X or S3 (and same power!)+nice design and very 
comfortable in use+awesome,big, colorful screen (4.7)+fast as hell (thanks @ tegra 3 quadcore)+better battery than 
SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 or HTC ONE X BUT-camera (video ok, but photos are bad because 
he phone has problems with the auto focus, an update could fix this!)-although it has 
the best (look on the technical information) battery of the flagship smartphones, it still lasts 
up to one day but not longer !( so need to charge at night)Summary: LG 
did a really good job, nice phone for less money (than the other flagships !) 
and it can really mess with the S3 or the iPhone5 ! It is incredible 
how smooth this smartphone works, i never saw a bug once and also movies and 
games are INSANE on this screen! But they need to fix the camera auto focus 
via an update.Update: This Phone is optimized for Europe and Asia (I am from germany, 
thats why i bought it) and you will get e.g. with t-mobile only 2g data 
(EDGE) over here! In Europe and Asia you will get up to HSDPA, so it 
works great over there.Buy it, its worth it if you love android !
