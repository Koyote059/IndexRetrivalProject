Easily the best phone I've owned. Period. Great battery life compared with my last 3 
phones (xperia Z2/Note 4/LG G4) Extremely fast, reliable, easily manages all my applications (55), great 
camera, waterproof.. And on and on... Great phone.. Really worth the price. Chose it over 
the S7 due screen size and battery life expectancy.
