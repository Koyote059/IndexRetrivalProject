Great dumb phone. I have both an AT&T and T-Mobile sim in the phone simultaneously. 
When I make a call I choose what sim I want to use. There are 
no bells and whistles in this phone. But it is great if you need two 
lines. Work and personal in the same phone. Or US and (other country) when you 
travel.
