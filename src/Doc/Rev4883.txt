There's nothing intuitive about this phone, & unlike some other smart phones, it's neither attractive 
nor reliable. I suspect it thinks it's smarter than the user, as it frequently hangs 
up in the middle of a call (without being touched), or suddenly starts calling another 
number, loudly, while I'm in the middle of a conversation (and then has the audacity 
to hang up on my call and put the call IT chose to initiate through 
instead.) It will also hang up on the call I'm in the middle of if 
someone (ANYone) happens to text me, and if I get another call while I'm on 
the phone, it will hang up on my current call, flash the info of the 
incoming call, then hang up on that one too. I was so fed up that 
I had the phone replaced (for the exact same phone, on the assumption that it 
was a defect in that particular phone, not the model in general), but this one 
has many of the same issues as well. (And a few quirks of its own, 
too.) I regret buying it. Save yourself the stress and frustration and skip this phone.
