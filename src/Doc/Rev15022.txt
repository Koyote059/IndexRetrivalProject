It is a 7in phone for 130 bucks so my expectations were lowThe good: Video, 
web browsing and playing music over headphones all look/sound good enough (most of my needs)The 
bad: No wifi calling on tmobile, call audio is low, could also use more ramWould 
I still buy it again, yeah because I wanted to try a phablet (I have 
a note 3)Would I go back to a smaller screen, nope!
