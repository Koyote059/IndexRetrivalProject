I bought this phone to replace a lost Samsung S4 because ATT no longer allows 
"free" upgrades on the family share plans, they make you by the phone through the 
NEXT program. The Posh with KitKat is much faster than the S4 and for my 
purposes works just as well. The only feature that may not be as good is 
the camera. It takes acceptable photos, but is not as good in difficult situations.
