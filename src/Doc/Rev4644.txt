This proved to be a very expensive purchase.The phone worked OK for about one week, 
then stopped charging and communicating via a verified-good Apple OEM Lightening cord and charger.I took 
the phone, charger and Lightening cord to an Apple store for warranty service and was 
informed that phone had originally been sold 14 months earlier, and was out of warranty. 
Also, charger and Lightening cord supplied with phone were deemed to be non-Apple aftermarket copy 
cat products.I contacted the vendor (TechRay) through Amazon, and the vendor offered to take phone 
back. However the phone's battery was now dead and phone contained personal data and about 
200 contacts. Rather than returning phone to vendor and risking compromise of personal data, I 
took it to Apple, paid the $269 repair fee, and was issued a new white 
5c 32 GB.There were other clues this phone was gray market, and not in fact, 
new:1. The phone's Model Number (A1529) Part No., Serial No., and IMEI/MEID printed on the 
back of the plastic box did not match those of the actual phone (A1532, MF154LL/A, 
etc.) contained in that box. The printing also contains typos (e.g., Part No. is given 
as "325LL/A" in one place and "MF 352LL/A" in another). Also, the indicated part number(s) 
(MF325LL/A or MF352LL/A) printed on the box, seem to be invalid or non-existent.2. Once removed 
from the box, the phone was found to have a printed paper sticker on its 
back stating that it was an iPhone 5c, 32 GB, for use on the Verizon 
network, and with correct Model No., Part No., IMEI, etc. When this sticker was peeled 
off it revealed a ring of old adhesive from a previous round sticker that had 
been previously removed.
