There are a lot of things to like about this phone. The two way hinge 
is genius although I am worried that it may fail after repeated use. I also 
love the adaptable keyboard which automatically changes from dialpad to text mode depending on which 
way the phone is opened. Theres also a keyboard select button that allows you to 
switch manually. Wi-Fi would have made this phone damn near perfect. There are a few 
things I must complain about. There doesn't seem to be a windows interface. It's not 
mentioned in the manual or on the website. Windows 7 recognizes the device when connected 
but then fails to find drivers or software for it. Adding files to the phone 
requires removal of the memory card and attachment to the PC thru a card reader. 
The interface between the phone and the Memory card could also use a bit of 
work. Ringtones seem to only work when downloaded through Verizon. The device seems incapable of 
simply accessing them from the card directory. I've also had problems getting bluetooth to function 
with other devices, for instance, with my garmin gps I can place calls but once 
connected I can't transmit voice or keypad entries. It's a shame Samsung decided to scrap 
this model and pursue I-Phone replicas. With a little tweaking this could have been the 
perfect phone.
