The touch-screen system is REALLY BAD. When writing text, other letters rather than the wanted 
one are pressed, which makes it very uncomfortable. Besides, the text-corrector software sucks. The camera 
is pretty low-resolution, which is OK by me because I rarely use it.The reason I 
bought this phone is that it's the cheapest 4G LTE phone with 64GB expandible memory. 
But I should have probably payed 50 more bucks for a better BLU model, and 
get a phone which doesn't go crazy when writing text.
