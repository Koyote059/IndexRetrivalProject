I have a Blu phone which I love Hubby decided to trade in his old 
phone for a smart phone. The Star 4.5" is perfect for him. It is easy 
to use, easy to hold and not too big. The Blu phones are unlocked so 
you can use them with most carriers. We both use Cricket Wireless who uses AT&T. 
Comes with a current version of Android and the phone will most likely want to 
update when you first start using it. You can teather to your pc or use 
it as a wireless hot spot for internet access. Be sure to buy a mico 
sd card as the phone doesn't have much internal memory. Our whole family have Blu 
phones and we love them"
