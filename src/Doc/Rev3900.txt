I choose this rating because the phone performances well and as promised (wifi works fine 
and etc.) (+1 star)What I like about this product is that it is easy to 
carry around with little worry, the size of it fits any pockets, and the price 
is decent. (+2 star)What I dislike about the product is that in the title description 
it says unlocked phone but mine came as locked. Might be an error on the 
sellers part but I was too lazy to go through with returning it and waiting 
again so I purchase an unlock code myself which costed more money (so the -2 
stars)I would not recommend this to friends cause I don't want them to go through 
the extra hassle that I had to get my phone working.
