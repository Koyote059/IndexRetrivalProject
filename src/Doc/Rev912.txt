Great phone for the price. My almost 2yr old LG G2 needed to be replaced, 
but I didn't want to spend hundreds on a phone. I found ASUS ZenFone 2 
and decided to give it a shot. Not bad at all for the price. Screen 
size, overall features and many customizing option from ASUS. The reason I didn't give 5 
stars is lagging issues and gallery issue. My 2yr old G2 still restarts under 10sec. 
This phone takes awhile to reboot. Sliding pages/app screens are bit laggy sometimes. My biggest 
issue is 'Gallery'. I have over 1k photos and ASUS stock gallery app doesn't have 
scroll bar! I'll get by using 3rd party app...but usually my previous phones; Samsung, HTC, 
LG... they all had decent stock apps. I hope they fix this issue soon...Still, considering 
the price and features, this phone is so far the best.
