nowhere did the description say the phone was a refurb. i turned on service and 
got texts for someone else. also everything was in spanish! i needed a translator to 
change the options!ive had prepaid service 1 day and its crashing. i can't go on 
the app store. and my balance is $0 after refilling 50$ this afternoon. I've done 
nothing!Hoping it straightens out. I convinced my husband to switch to blackberry.
