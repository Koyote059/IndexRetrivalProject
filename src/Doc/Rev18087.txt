This phone was great at first but now it gets hot at the top where 
the camera and fingerprint sensor is. Now have NO SIGNAL. I got an update yesterday 
and now I can't talk on my phone because I have no signal. The phone 
has gotten extremely slow over the weeks and I don't have many apps downloaded to 
my phone and the battery life LACK thereof is horrible!!I hate to say it but 
I'm done with Android. I've always been team Android but I have been let down 
too many times. ð
