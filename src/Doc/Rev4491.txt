My hobby is a different cell phone every 6 month's.Exterior.The body, handling feeling of this 
device is definitely premium. Glass & metal all the way around however is very slippery. 
The copper color is probably close to a rose gold, it's really a beautiful phone.Display.While 
still being 1080P it's a awesome display. The contrast, is excellent. It's a pretty cold 
display but you can adjust that. Brightest is just outstanding, easily be seen in direct 
sunlight.Software.It's been updated to lollipop. Software is fast, not to intrusive, & a pleasure to 
use.Hardware.With the 801 processor pushing a 1080p display, 3GB Ram on lollipop, well this thing 
Flys!Battery.Simply put, it's awesome. 17 hour's, with 5 hour's of screen on time is excellent. 
The other thing it does charge faster than reviews have stated IF you get a 
2 amp or better charger.Sony had made a device I would put in the top 
3 available. Along side the Note 4 & other's.
