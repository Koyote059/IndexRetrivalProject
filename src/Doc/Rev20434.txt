Bought this phone to replace my on-contract phone when it broke. This phone has so 
many negatives and the frustrations it causes aren't even worth the low price. The touch 
screen is inaccurate, the phone often freezes and slows way down and needs to be 
restarted. Even when I moved most of my apps to the SD card, it still 
didn't have enough memory to update some apps, and I don't even have that many. 
Today it randomly set the time back 3 hours and so the alarm woke me 
up early. The only good things are that the screen is pretty clear and the 
battery has good life.
