Disappointed. I have a ZTE ZMAX over two years old. I found very little has 
improved the last two years. The Axon 7 mini has fingerprint and expanded memory ability 
but it's very sluggish working within applications. I have to press multiple times on the 
screen to get it to respond. Except for a few new features my old ZMAX 
runs rings around this phone.
