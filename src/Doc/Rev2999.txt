Got it used for $152 they said it was in good condition but it came 
like new 9.5/10 coming from a moto g which is a great phone i definitely 
notice a big diference on the screen quality fron lcd to amoled, the biggest upgrade 
coming from the moto g is the camera of the moto x, it takes great 
pictures, they're not amazing but it gets the job done pretty decently, battery life is 
also better and overall the phone feels more premium and it is a smoother experience 
on the OS for $152 i would say this phone is a steal.
