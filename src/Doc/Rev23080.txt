I was very excite when this arrived due to all the great review. Right of 
the bat, the phone said I am on a lower IOS update so it won't 
be able to transfer my content from my old iPhone to this. But I ignored 
it. I had to individually redownload all my apps. Netflix won't work. It won't let 
me update my iOS. Has Chinese lettering in the back, like wtf. So many problems 
with this. I wish I could return this or get a replacement because this is 
bull-crap
