This is a pretty good phone. I enjoy it the only downside is its an 
LG. The RAM on this phone is around 10MB so if you have a full 
inbox your phone can run very slow and delayed. Another downside is the lack of 
video, flash camera, and music player. The main thing i tend to not enjoy is, 
this phone will randomly turn off. I will glance at my phone and i get 
a black screen. I push a button and then i get the power up screen. 
This can be frustrating at times. Other than the random shutting off and lack of 
RAM, i would recommend this phone
