this phone has a very bad problem with voice recognition it gets on voice recognition 
and would not let you make Corrections with the keyboard it makes a lot of 
mistakes with voice recognition and it will make you sound like an idiot I wish 
I would have just went to T-Mobile and got a brand name phones with properly 
written software this phone has great features and wonderful screen power and everything but the 
software blows it's not very goodthis phone has a very bad problem with voice recognition 
it gets locked on voice recognition and one not let you make corrections with the 
keyboa I wish I would have just went to T Mobile and got a brand 
new phone with probably written software this phone has great features and wonderful screen power 
and everything but the software blows a its not very goodrd it makes a lot 
in the steaks with. as you see it does everything you say voice recognitionvoice recognition 
is just horrendous I hate this phoneUpdate:The phone is not that bad. I will point 
out that the software is just not as good quality as Samsung or HTC. My 
gf has Samsung 7 and it is nicer, the speakers of this are louder, but 
the software is buggy, have not been able to cast to Roku, and had issues 
with initial startup. I am happy with the purchase and accustomed to it now, but 
the cost saving does show in the software. In my opinion. I do like the 
phone, and the issue with text repeating has stopped.
