For those of you who want to know why this is so expensive, I tell 
you why. You pay almost $1000 and stay in line for couple days just to 
get an iPhone which another 10 million people will buy then you should not complain 
about this phone. This is like you buy a limited edition car which they make 
a couple thousand of not millions. This is a symbol of wealth just like a 
Vertu phone if you have ever seen one. The camera is great A-Z is great 
and so is the battery; which is the most important thing!
