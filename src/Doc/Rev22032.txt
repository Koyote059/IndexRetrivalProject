When it comes to smartphones, I buy stuff and not brand. My BlackBerry 9700 just 
decided to die on me out of nowhere, so I'm in a tight budget to 
have a phone. Samsung is always my go-to in unplanned situation, so here I am. 
I don't mind the outdated OS, since I don't really work using my phone. Apps 
and stuff are easy to navigate and add. The camera is of good quality, but 
I haven't tried taking pictures at night. The speaker is good, too. Plus, mine comes 
with an extra back casing in white. Perhaps the only thing I haven't tried is 
using this outside the US. I hope I'll be able to soon.
