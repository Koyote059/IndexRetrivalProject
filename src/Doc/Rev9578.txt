I ordered the Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken from PUT 
group USA and received the item exactly as it was described (i.e. new). The phone 
holds its charge as expected (about two days of light use) and worked seamlessly once 
I inserted my T-Mobile sim card. Comes with the latest OS with which it is 
compatible(6.1.3). Note that OS 7 is not supported on the 3GS, but the majority of 
apps will run on it, as does iCloud. Given the cost of new iPhones (which 
are admittedly more powerful with crisper displays) I think the $149 that this goes for 
is a good bargain. If you are also looking for a reasonably priced case, see 
theÂ eForCity 2 x TPU Rubber Skin Case Compatible With AppleÂ® iPhoneÂ® 3G / 3GS, 
Clear Smoke CircleÂ which I bought for under $3 including postage. For some inexplicable reason 
this is cheaper than buying a single case of exactly the same type. It fits 
the phone snugly, feels nice to the touch, and offers good protection against damage.
