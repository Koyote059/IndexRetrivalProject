The defender case doesn't fit worth a damn. The hole in the screen protector doesn't 
line up with the home button and looks odd and out of place. I've had 
three of these cases all with the same issue. Wouldn't recommend this case to anyone, 
not for this particular phone at least. 3 stars because amazon had great customer service 
and exchanged the cases.
