Clear connection A lot clearer than my Samsung phone with Sprint I chose to connect 
with TMobile I get four or more bars in heavy storms where my expensive cell 
phone gave me under two in the same conditions. Plugged in a memory card, downloaded 
apps, google maps, etc and everything is working great It has a nice slick feel 
and design to it No one knows how little I paid for the phone because 
it works so well ***Back cover doesn't close correctly on phone and since Amazon doesn't 
give an invoice with IMEI number on it manufacturer will not honor warranty
