It's a good phone and well worth the price. It just has some minor problems.There 
are some really bad pre-installed apps that you can't delete (FM Radio, Internet Explorer, etc.). 
You can counter this by choosing custom apps in the store, however Windows doesn't have 
nearly the same selection/variety that Android Smartphones have.Microsoft Office is really good on the go 
for those moments a burst of inspiration one might get without having a pen and 
paper available to jot down ideas. There is also OneDrive storage available for any of 
your file needs--Or you can insert a Micro SD of your choosing. Nearly half of 
the phone's 8GB storage is used on system files.Had no problems using the phone/messaging programs. 
Make sure you read the details about which companies are suitable for it. CDMA networks 
don't work with this phone (Verizon, T-Mobile).
