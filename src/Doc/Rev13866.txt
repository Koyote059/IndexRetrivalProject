It happened that I would never imagine to have to return the iPhone I have 
bought and to ask for refund because I trusted it would be a new item, 
which should not have been used before.I can remember I have red in the item 
description at Amazon site, this iPhone was being sold as ânew condition itemâ according to 
the statement announced.I stayed totally disappointed when the guy from Apple Support Department told me: 
- âthis iPhone you bought was not a new item. It was already activated, by 
the end of 2012... Someone owned this phone beforeâ. In spite of this situation, the 
screen did not work. The screen was damaged as you will can observe in the 
attached pictures.I am so sorry to participate through this awkward situation.Regards,Eduardo Martins Santos
