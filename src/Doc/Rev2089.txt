I just bought a Samsung Gavity 3 and I do like the phone. Although I 
don't like how there is no reject button for unwanted calls or that the emo-cons 
are plain, I do love how clear the music player sounds and how loud it 
can get. On my other phone if I received unwanted calls, I could put the 
number on a block list so whenever they called, it would go straight to voicemail. 
Still trying everything to see how it works but overall, a great phone. I would 
recommend this phone.
