This is a PREPAID ONLY phone! Can NOT be added to existing lines. Our daughters 
phone broke and we order this as a replacement. After an hour on the phone 
with Verizon who contacted ZTE on my behalf, ZTE denied the model number was a 
ZTE product and said its s Hewlett Packard product. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY 
unless you use a prepaid phone and need ZERO customer service.
