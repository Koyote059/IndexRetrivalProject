I bought one Iphone,supossed to be new, with this seller and the Iphone came broken 
I took it to a guy to put my sim card in it and the 
guy told me that the screen had already been changed and that the Iphone already 
had contact with water. And today my Iphone broke and I can't make calls or 
receive, I can't access the internet or my messages.
