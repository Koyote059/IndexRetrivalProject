DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE....when i got the phone last year some months later it 
started to over heat to the point i had to remove the battery and place 
it by the fan to cool off or if i am driving out of the 
window after little over a year, one day two weeks ago I rest down the 
phone to go on the pc at work when I picked it up it was 
dead and this suppose to be a 'brand new phone' is now dead on which 
i had a 24 month warranty. contacted the sellers and they had the nerve to 
tell me to contact Samsung . I do not know why Amazon are letting these 
bogus sellers keep running their scamps on ppl so I am out of a phone 
and the phone is of no use again . AGAIN DONOT BUY THIS PHONE ....i 
tried changing the battery and its not the battery so i know its the phone/ 
never fell in water or placed in water ....PLEASE PPL THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE 
SHELLING OUT $200 FOR A NO GOOD PRODUCT. Amazon needs to do something about these 
sellers. (Samsung Korea)
