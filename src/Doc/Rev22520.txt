I bought this phone because my old one was missing a ton of calls, sending 
them straight to VM. I love the look and style of this phone. It came 
fully up to date with the jellybean thingy. I am with Metropcs and even though 
this is an AT&T phone they have a new thing where you can bring your 
own device. It cost me $45 to have it put onto metro service with a 
new sim card, but I feel it was worth it. Even the lady in the 
metro store fell in love with it and was showing it to the other staff! 
I'm still learning all the functions but overall I'm really happy with this phone.
