Great phones! We knew they would be - we've been using this same model for 
probably eight years already (our old ones were getting tired). This model isn't fancy but 
it gets the job done. And it works at home (my husband tried a different 
new flip phone that would work at the AT&T store in town but would not 
ring at our home). Plus they arrived earlier than expected.
