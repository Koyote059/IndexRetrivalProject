solid phone, bigger than I've hoped (had 1st Moto G and was super happy with 
it's size...)... Finger scan works beautifully and fast, when I was deciding on Plus vs 
'normal' Moto G thought that finger scan would be nothing more than 'nice to have' 
- now is proving super useful, especially as our IT sec policies are stringent and 
require min 6 digit PIN. With finger scan it is a breeze, it's fast and 
reliable... Camera is - mediocre. have not played with settings a lot, but photos somehow 
seem a bit out of focus (even with focusing on object, etc). not saying that 
they are blurred or anything, just comparing to other cameras out there photis seem to 
be lacking depth, etc. everything else really works great - phone is super fast and 
feels nice in the hand. again, if only it was a bit smaller, it would 
again be an unbeatable combo...
