I previously owned an Xperia z1. I loved the phone, but needed an upgrade.So far, 
the only issue I've had with this in the first week of use has been 
overheating whilst charging and using camera at the same time. ð¬I hope it's not a 
preview of future performance, as the z1 only started acting up after it had been 
accidently dropped on numerous occasions. Headphones, interestingly, we're not included. Love the ease of the 
interface, and excellent camera quality. Miss the glass backing.
