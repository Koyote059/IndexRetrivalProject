I have had this phone for a month already, and I can say that I 
am still discovering new features I didn't know it had... Even after watching tutorial videos 
I still find new things.Iphone 5? You can't compare that to the Note 2. It 
would be like comparing a BMW 335i to a Bentley Continental Supersports.If you are looking 
for a phone, get this one.Update 07/10/2013Unfortunately my phone suffers of the SDS (sudden death 
syndrome) and it freezes and crashes like 5-6 times every day... this is getting very 
frustrating since I spent almost $700 on this phone just 8 months ago. I never 
rooted or did anything you are not supposed to do with this phone. I made 
some research about this problem and it appears like lots of other Note IIs and 
Samsung Galaxy S IIIs suffer from this same problem. I wish I could get a 
replacement or my money back, things like this happening to such High-end (expensive) phone is 
plain ridiculous. I am very disappointed with you Samsung! I hope I am contacted my 
someone.Thank you.Update 07/13/2013This is completely unacceptable!!! This phone now freezes as soon as I reboot 
it when trying to unfreeze it!!! This is my second bad experience with "high end" 
Samsung devices!!! I will never buy from Samsung again, sorry but you lost a very 
good LOYAL (bought several big screen TVs, a sound bar and mobile devices all the 
time) customer because of this awful experience with devices I payed for $685 (Note II) 
and $630 (Galaxy Tab 10.1 that had very bad screen problems.I hope at least anyone 
in here takes the time to contact me.
