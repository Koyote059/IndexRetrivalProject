I have had my phone for about two weeks now and I am loving it. 
because it is my first smartphone I had to get a new sim card from 
AT&T, but as an out of contract customer this was provided at no cost to 
me. I am still trying to learn all of the bells and whistles and as 
it has been on the market for several years I'm sure there are other phones 
out there that have a lot more bling, but this one is good for me. 
the only real con I have found is because it is an older model phone 
I cannot find the type case and screen protector I want for the phone.. but 
I have a cute case on it (not so great for protection ) and hopefully 
since I have a quite lifestyle the screen will not need a protector. I tried 
the film kind and they did not work very well. For someone like me who 
just wants a good basic smart phone that has good internet features for accessing things 
like facebook and e-mail.. weather.. maps etc. it is a very good phone for the 
money. Looks great as well.. I love the white color.(especailly with my pink case)
