You definitely get what you pay for with the Blu Advance 4.0 phone. This phone 
lags...big time. It definitely takes longer than 5 seconds to open up an app and 
sometimes you just get a black screen and have to exit out of the app 
and then back again to get it to work. The GPS doesn't know what it's 
doing half the time and just outright fails the rest of the time. The screen 
on this phone is also horrible. Words come out blurry and when you try zoom 
in closer to make the words somewhat legible, the screen lags. However, the worst thing 
on this phone is the keyboard. It absolutely sucks! There are very few times that 
it will actually type the letter I want. It usually types the letter next to 
it. The delete button has to be hit a few times to work, it's just 
a complete nightmare. It's making it a nuisance to text.Overall, I don't really like this 
Blu Advance phone. It's just a laggy mess. I've had Blu phones before, but this 
one is definitely the worst of the bunch. Thank God, I'm not much of a 
phone user (only use it for internet on the go and even then most places 
have wifi, so I tend to use my iPod Touch), because if I was, I 
would send it back. Seeing as how I don't use this much and don't want 
to go through the hassle of a return, I'm keeping it. But I do not 
recommend it in the slightest.
