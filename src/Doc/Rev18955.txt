I really wanted to love this phone. I finally decided to try a BlackBerry again 
after so many years of using Apple/Android phones. I didn't want to pay too much 
for one and I didn't want a physical keyboard. I wanted to get the Z30 
but it doesn't have all the AT&T LTE bands so I opted with this one. 
After receiving the phone my initial impression was that it looked cheap and it was 
heavy. I then started it up and things set up fine. But then I starting 
using the phone and became very frustrated. Everything kept freezing up or had significant lag. 
I rebooted the phone in hopes this would help but it did not. I then 
restored the phone and started over. Same result. Not what I remember as the high 
BB standard!On the positive side I do love the BB10 OS and therefore I returned 
this and am getting the Passport as I hear that one is a Ferrari compared 
to this Ford. I'm crossing my fingers that is performs as expected and that the 
physical keyboard doesn't bother me too much.
