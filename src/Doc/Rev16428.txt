great looking and everything BUT the one i got was defective -.-when i slide up 
the screen to use the QWERTY keybaord the keys P(/),M(?), the left arrow key do 
not work. i am ver sad about that and when i want to use those 
keys i have to close my phone and use the touch screen then slide it 
back up agian to continue using it. VERY ANNOYING. someimes restarts randomly. this is the 
last time i buy a cellphone on amamzon.
