The product itself I love. (the iphone 6) This listing though is a little misleading. 
It does NOT come with an SIM card. This ad says it is for Verizon 
wireless network, but when I took it to the Verizon store, they said it is 
not a Verizon phone. They also said it should have came with and SIM card. 
If it weren't for my daughter having and iphone on my account, I would NOT 
have been able to activate this phone. That being said. Did not like the hoops 
that I had to jump through to get the phone working, but since I have 
got it working, I really do like the iphone 6!!!
