This phone is fast and powerful, dual core processor and 4g, best bang for your 
buck if you want something under 250, but it does not have android 4.0 or 
above, thats why I took one star off. I highly recommend this.UPDATE: I sent this 
phone in for some warranty repair and LG DID NOT fix it, so I waste 
my money, it did not have any physical damage or anything, so, I will never 
buy another LG product again!!!
