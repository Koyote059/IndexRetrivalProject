I've been using this phone for a couple of days now, and after watching, reading, 
and hearing all these reviews as well as feedback from others, I had an idea 
of what to expect going into purchasing this device.I saw a few have issues with 
the phone bending, similar to the iPhone 6 Plus when that first released. I've been 
babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible, and in that 
time I've fallen in love. My personal experience is the UI is nice and clean, 
similar to stock Android with a few added extras, and it's very responsive. I know 
it's not 4K all the time, and until the Marshmallow update releases, there won't be 
much support as of yet, however the up scaling of videos in the YouTube app 
still look simply amazing. The camera isn't really want most hyped it up to be, 
but I find that it works well and edges out my Note 4 and my 
father's iPhone 6S Plus, which is perfect enough for me.From the general feel of the 
build quality, I'd have to mark Sony down as the "Apple" of Androids, since I 
haven't personally felt that the other Android devices did it for me. I tried the 
Note 5, S6 Edge Plus, iPhone 6S Plus, Nexus 6P, and multiple others, but the 
Xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me. Calls sound crystal clear, 
and the front facing speakers, while not as powerful as some HTC or Motorola phones, 
still sound much better than my previous iPhone.All in all, love the device, hope Sony 
continues to push out updates for it in the future, and I may stick with 
them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices.
