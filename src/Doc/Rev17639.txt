I love mine, hands down very durable and lived through what I've done to it 
in a month... Which is quite a bit. No major issues and no conflicts with 
operating system to apps. Smooth, fast, and awesome built in cameras and video recorder. Awesome 
phone for a person not quite sold on the ideas and exaggerations of Iphone. Mine 
was purchased new still manufacturer sealed, not used.
