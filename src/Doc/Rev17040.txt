#First Impresion.My last phone was Samsung Galaxy Duos and I upgrade my phone to this 
one looking for a phonewith much faster performance and better build quality, since I mostly 
use my phone for communicating with people,taking pictures once in a while and watching random 
youtube videos.I bought the white version and so far I really love the build quality!The 
quick charger works pretty well. It took me around 1 hour to fully charge the 
Xperia X from 30% to 100%.(Since I came from a very old phone) The camera 
is great, the screen is gorgeous andthe phone size is just perfect for my hand.# 
2 weeksAfter two weeks using this phone I just can say that I really enjoy 
using this phone.The battery life can sustain for 1.5 day if you don't use the 
phone often (just chatting, looking social media, browsing a little bit).But if you use it 
for gaming, it can only last for 3-4 hours. Since I only use this phone 
forcommunication, and some browsing, it's totally fit the purpose. And the quick charging feature also 
works fine.Again, camera is superb for me. And the dual front speaker is also great 
to listen.Also, I have never experienced any lagging so far.Last thing, I realized why the 
build quality of this phone is so beautiful when I tried to compare my phoneto 
my friend's iPhone 6s. And it turns out that their build quality are similar.The only 
difference is that this Sony phone is thicker, which is still acceptable for me.Some negatives 
that you might experience:- fingerprint sensor is installed, but you can not use it in 
US version - that's unfortunate,- i occasionally miss-type on the swift keyboard - somehow i 
feel it is too dense.But other than that it's just a great phone.Since the price 
of this phone is a little bit cheaper than a new iPhone SE 16GB,I will 
easily choose this phone over the iPhone SE.
