I like it very much overall.. It's long, thin, sleek an bigger then a IPhone 
6 & 6+ Plus it's an Android what more can U ask for. The back 
camera is the best, front camera isn't all that but it's OK.. The only problem 
I have is that I can't send pictures throu texting. I can like on FB, 
Instagram an FB messager but if I'm texting an wanna send a picture I can't, 
take to long to signanon then respond saying it didn't get throu which I have 
done everything that trouble shooting says to do an even ask my phone provider that 
just says it's just the phone for some reason an an call that particular company 
that made the device. It's very irritating. So for now the phone is OK but 
I know eventually I'm get me another phone that I wouldn't have this problem with.
