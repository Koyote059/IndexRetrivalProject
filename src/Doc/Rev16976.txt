I have purchase this phone for my best friend. I have waited 1 month to 
post a review. Honestly do not buy it here because if you got an invite 
it is much cheaper. This phone is amazing. What a great quality built, damn. I 
have use practically all type of smartphone from iphone,samsung,htc,moto X etc.. But what a great 
quality built. I highly recommend this phone. I got some minor bugs that were fixed 
easily and some annoying features but it worth every penny.Pros:1. Quality Build2. Battery Life3. Display4. 
Monster hardware5. Amazing softwareCons:1. Not the best camera in the worldConclusion: It is a great 
all around smartphone. I highly recommend it :)
