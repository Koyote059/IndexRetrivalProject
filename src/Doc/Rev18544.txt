I've had this phone for over a month and I love it! Best phone I've 
owned so far. Really like that I can switch to any GSM carrier just by 
switching out the sim card. The price to value ratio is amazing. Don't think about 
it, just pull the trigger and order it before BLU comes to their senses! Already 
ordered one for my brother and my wife is next. You will not regret it!Pros:Unlocked 
(use with any GSM carrier, no bloatware, more space and memory available of the user 
and apps, ect.)Easy process to set up.2 sim card slots! I don't use this feature, 
but GREAT to know it's there.Takes external memory card up to 64 GB.Ships with Android 
Lollipop.FM Radio (use this more than I thought I would.)Both front and back cameras are 
great! (was concerned with all the complaints, but works great for my needs.)Screen looks nice. 
(same as above, lots of complaints from others, but I need a larger screen, so 
good for my needs.)Battery life lasts a full day, plus.Screen protector INCLUDED.Case INCLUDED.Headphones INCLUDED.Already has 
a phone update for download.Cons:Sound is too low. (use these steps to fix this: https://youtu.be/Si3y9MePWZk 
)Bigger and heavier than I was expecting.Battery is NOT user replaceable.
