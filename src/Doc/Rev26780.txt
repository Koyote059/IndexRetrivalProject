Worked in Israel, which was the reason for purchase. Popped a sim card in upon 
landing and I was good to go. We bought a bunch of these to use 
for my Production and each crew member was then able to call and text one 
another. Was able to use my iphone earbuds plugged to the phone. Battery lasted for 
DAYS even with continued use. Has video recorder and sound recorder, which I never used, 
but nice to know it's there. The phone comes defaulted in a foreign language, but 
I was able to figure out how to change it to English. Changed a bunch 
of the factory settings, like the FM radio was too easy to accidentally turn on, 
and I had to activate the lock keypad, oh, and raise the volume when I 
received calls. It's cheap, simple, served its basic purpose of calling and texting incountry. When 
we had wifi, people used their iphones to imessage and facetime, but if anyone in 
your group is on an Android or whenever you don't have wifi, these phones were 
perfectly handy.
