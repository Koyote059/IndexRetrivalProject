So far so good, day 4. It's like my Samsung Note tablet but smaller. Previous 
phone was Nokia Lumina 635 ....this blows that out of the water. Fast enough for 
me, works fine with Cricket, although reception bars showing low most of the time but 
no trouble making calls or sending text. Some display settings are lacking IMO but nothing 
big enough to make me dislike the phone. Easy to use. Great camera, love that 
there's flash on front and back. Back of phone seems fragile but i use a 
case anyway so really doesn't matter much. Battery ran pretty low on day 2, have 
used on lowest brightness since and holding better. Came two days before expected arrival date, 
but took a lot more time than i thought it would. I have small hands 
so hard to use one handed but not a deal breaker. Overall I'm pretty happy 
with it so far.
