Great flashly, functional phone with limted range of features. If you DON'T want an all-in-one 
(organizer,ipod w/ video,internet,e-mail) this is the phone for you. However, I quickly bucked up and 
upgraded to a cingular iphone (had cingular customer buy one on his account) i then 
unlocked for t-mobile. Don't buy an unlocked iphone, largely for finacial purposes but also you 
want to learn how to upgrade your own unlocked iphone. Iphone is the only phone 
with an operating system constantly upgrading and improving so you want to give your self 
that ability and save $300+ at the same time. Hope this helps...
