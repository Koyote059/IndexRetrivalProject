So I'm very careful with my phones and electronics. Pretty much every aspect of this 
phone became broken in a few months. Soon after arrival the 1/8" jack malfunctioned and 
only sent audio to one side of any headphones. Then multiple buttons on the keyboard 
stopped working, and soon it was just shutting off and restarting randomly, daily.Currently using an 
LG G2 and I've had it for far longer than I had the Droid 2. 
No problems.I would say my case is uncommon but I've had a few other droids 
and most of them broke down over the course of a year while my LG 
or Samsung phones are in fine working condition for years.
