After 5 months using this phone i can say this is the worst smartphone i've 
ever had. Fortunately i didn't replace my iphone for the Q10 so i use this 
blackberry as second line.How about cheek hang up and cheek speaker during your calls? You 
answer a call on a meeting to say you can't speak and your cheek suddenly 
activate the speaker so everyone else at the room can hear the other side talking 
to you.The reason i've chosen it is to have a physical keyboard but in fact 
it is even worse than touchscreen ones. The OS sucks once it freezes often and 
you must restart the phone removing its battery. Very often when you drop it at 
a table (smoothly!) it restarts (probably because of a battery poor contact). Well, blackberry never 
again. There's no miracle on the market and a product always tells its company's condition. 
Thats why RIM is RIM and Apple is Apple.
