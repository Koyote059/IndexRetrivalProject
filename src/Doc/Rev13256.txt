Purchased this product as new. Proximity sensor failed. Apple support told me this phone was 
purchased in 2011and had no factory warranty. Company will not do any replacement after 30 
days, so beware. I have a phone that I cannot use for phone calls. I 
will not purchase from these people as they state the product is new, but it 
is not!,
