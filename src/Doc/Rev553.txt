Super Cool Qaud Band Watch Touch Screen Cell Phone WhiteI chose 4 stars mainly because 
it didn't come the way it was advertised. On my 'Super Cool Quad Band Touch 
Screen Watch' it only had 6 icons on the screen instead of 9 like it's 
advertised, that being said...i guess i didn't get all the features advertised in the ad 
i saw. The ad i saw advertised internet, java games, mp3/4, fm, and more (i 
have the other features).When i got it i purchased a prepaid tmobile sim and micro 
sd card and it worked right away. When i got homme i loaded the sd 
card with music and that worked as well ( i think you have to load 
music to both phone and sd card for it to work). I charged my bluetooth 
and it connect right away. The camera and video camera works surprisingly well. The texting 
is okay, only because you have to use a tiny stylus, but i think the 
size would be perfect for a kid.(Side Note: I am not for young kids having 
cell phones, but this is DEFINITELY something i would give to my 12 and 9 
years old kids! It's discreet enough that a school official wouldn't take it based on 
looks, it doesn't have games on it to distract them. It has just enough to 
keep them entertained, and you as a parent can contact them in case of an 
emergency!...talk, text, and mp3/4 with bluetooth accessibility.So...all that being said i'd recommend this product to 
the person that wants the freedom to take their phone anywhere without the feeling of 
lugging around a bulky phone, that may or may not want to use bluetooth, that 
enjoys music, and doesn't mind texting with a tiny stylus!Note: If I find anything else 
that i like or dislike i will definitely add to this post if possible or 
create another. ENJOY!!! :o)
