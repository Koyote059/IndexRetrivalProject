initial impression using one day1 display gorgeous feels like high end device2 specs say 6000 
mah battery power management mark without using power intensive app battery drain quite pronounced noticeable 
hopefully samsung release patch fix this3camera impressive good lighting conditions result beautiful detailed shots struggles 
bit low light conditions overall quite ok price4 processor fastest job nothing complain about5 fingerprint 
scanner decent6 back case box take time get new case delivered case necessary back panel 
quite slippery7 believe cost around 17k instead 195k want non chinese phone good option consider
