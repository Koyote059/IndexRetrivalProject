This confirms why I hate Androids. The music player sucks. There's no adaptive brightness control 
for the screen. The buttons at the bottom are too easy to press accidentally. Settings 
are not intuitive. There are too many apps preinstalled, and overall it's interface is just 
"clunky" and not well though out .
