Considering that this is not an expensive phone with some ridiculous specs, this phone does 
everything it says it will do. The material is not the best but it comes 
with a case that you can use to add some protection just in case the 
phone is dropped.I think the picture quality is decent considering the price of the phone.Overall, 
if you are on a budget and looking for a phone capable of all the 
functions of some of the industry leaders (Galaxy S series), this is definitely a good 
buy.NOTE: I purchased the Global GSM version to use outside the United states. This version 
is not made for use in the United States. Based on what I've read, if 
you use the Global GSM version in the United States, you might experience slow data 
speeds.
