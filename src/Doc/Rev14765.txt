I got this phone as a replacement for an HTC phone I broke. I was 
enticed by the reviews I read, but since I have owned it (for about 2 
weeks) I've been mighty disappointed. It cannot hold a charge with normal phone functions being 
used for the entire day. If I use simple apps, Facebook, e-mail a few times 
a day it dies by 6PM. If I use Candy Crush or Navigation it dies 
by 3PM, and during candy crush or navigation it becomes overloaded and restarts the phone 
loosing all recent activities.I have not attempted to use Bluetooth since it's been a nightmare 
to keep a charge without using Bluetooth, but when school starts in a few weeks 
I'll be forced to connect to my car during my long commutes. I'd imagine the 
battery will need to be recharged even sooner.To activate this phone I had to increase 
the data on my Verizon account. My old plan had 1GB which was plenty, but 
this phone requires 2GB so now my phone bill is more expensive and I still 
only use .5GB.However, using this phone is very nice and the layout is user friendly. 
It works excellent with Google apps. The exterior is not cheap and feels very durable, 
the slide out keyboard retracts smoothly and the buttons are raised enough to locate the 
correct key without bumping the ones around it.Overall I wish I had my HTC Rhyme 
back, but only because the battery lasted for a few days even when I used 
navigation and candy crush, and the phone only required a 1GB data plan.
