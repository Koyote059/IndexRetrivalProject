I'm a big gamer, and I don't need to go over those features for you 
for the thousandth time, but after deciding not to upgrade to the Sony Xperia Z3 
or Z3+ due to the heating issues, and a couple other reasons, I drooled over 
the Xperia Z5 specs for months waiting to buy this phone in the U.S. with 
a warranty. I finally got it through Amazon, and this phone is absolutely blazing fast! 
However the number the Sony Guy provided me to purchase an additional warranty didn't pan 
out, I still feel this phone deserves a full 5 star review. The camera, the 
graphics, the power, The playstation integration for gamers, this phone is exactly what I have 
been waiting for to upgrade for my trusty Xperia Play R800 and I couldn't be 
happier. Unless of course it slid out into a PlayStation controller like the old R800's 
but the display, camera, and about everything else make this phone so vastly superior in 
every aspect. I'm not even mad the U.S. version didn't get a finger print scanner 
as there is a ton of apps for that, and that wasn't a selling point 
anyways for me. I am in love all over again with another great Xperia!
