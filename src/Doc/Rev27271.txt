Ã‚ I love this phone. I got the white one and it's very cute and 
i love how it looks on the surface. Before I buy things I always look 
on how nice it is on the outside, something that I can be proud of 
owning it and bringing with me everywhere for daily use. It has a good size 
that's about 5.5" QHD (960 x 540) which makes it easier for me to type 
and read articles and screenshots. I have been thinking about buying a new phone and 
gladly this came around and got it for free. It totally saves me lots of 
money at least a few hundreds. The phone that I am using right now cannot 
download the app that's very necessary for what I am doing online and so I 
was so happy that when I got this and tried downloading some of the apps 
it went through, I was definitely pumped. It works like a smartphone and very decent 
too. It connects to WiFi quickly and I never had problems except for my apps 
crashing down sometimes, other than that everything works perfectly as described. Very functional and it 
has great features that come with it. It's good to use as a back up 
phone. I recommend this product. I received this in exchange of my honest, unbiased review.
