I received the device and when you start using it , I find that when 
I make a call, nobody listens to me . In other words, the smartphone's microphone 
is useless. I live in Venezuela and the shipping company from USA gave me one 
weeks ago the phone. I need the seller of the device help me solve my 
problem . I will be grateful if you do so . Because I have a 
cell that does not serve me .
