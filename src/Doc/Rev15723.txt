This phone is truly amazing in that nothing gives way to performance for the price. 
Did a lot of research for an old flagship phone so I won't bust my 
budget and this one tops them. 3gb ram with an impressive screen. Camera great but 
could be faster, its even slower than the S4 and I bought this for the 
camera as one priority. The IR blaster is crap, definitely not enough power to even 
turn on anything when even an inch to the sensor. Bummer there but for the 
price it's a small compromise. In my opinion this topped my list of zenfone2 for 
the Camera qualify and S5 for the ram and screen. 3gb does really go a 
long way. Overall not a bad experience but guess they fixed these problems in the 
g4.
