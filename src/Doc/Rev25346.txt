Stellar phone for the price. To break it down:+ screen looks great+ great battery life, 
usually still have 50% left by the end of the day+ takes a 64GB SD 
card (sandisk - haven't tried other brands)+ good wifi and cell reception+ no noticible delays 
when running apps+ the mono-speaker gets pretty loud (though it's obviously still a phone speaker, 
so don't expect miracles)+ feels solid (doesn't feel cheap)- camera doesn't have autofocus. I didn't 
think I would mind this, but it turns out that the chase quickdeposit app requires 
an autofocus camera- the headphone output is quieter than expected. it's fine for actual headphone 
use, but when I hook it up to my car I usually have to crank 
my car volume about 2-3x as loud as normal.+/- it runs kitkat. that opens up 
a lot of the newest features, but it also means that you have limited use 
of your SD card. You can google "Kitkat SD card" for more info, but it 
was something I didn't realize when I bought it.Of course it would be great if 
the phone had LTE, 4K screen, etc....but for the money it will be tough to 
beat.
