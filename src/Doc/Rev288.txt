I live in Alaska and like to be out in the rain and mud for 
recreation. I also have four small children who play games on my phone, and I'm 
a gadget enthusiast who enjoys a well-functioning device. I wanted a phone that would work 
at least as well as my Asus/Google Nexus 7, and I was pleasantly surprised by 
the Rugby Pro. After disabling all of AT&T and Samsung's bloatware and installing AT&T's updated 
firmware, it is a very usable Android device. It is also tough enough that I 
don't worry if it gets dropped or grimy in the rain. I liked it so 
much that we got another for my wife. I don't know why most phones are 
made so fragile. For me, this one is tough enough for daily carry and powerful 
enough to enjoy using.
