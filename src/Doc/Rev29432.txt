Either the battery or the phone died after less than a week. Looking into getting 
some help with this via the one year warrenty. The form factor of this tiny 
phone is really nice, but it may be just a little too tiny to be 
completely useful. It does have a great "stealth" factor though, and is quite a conversation 
piece.The POSH Micro X is a fully functional Android phone, but the useability of apps 
varies due to the tiny screen, so your success will vary from app to app.I 
think cell phones in general are getting too big and I missed my old LG 
Optimus V, which was just the right size. The keypad of the Micro X is 
VERY small, but since I do most of my messaging via MightyText on the computer 
not a huge problem (I did buy an app called Big Buttons, which really helped). 
Try it out for a different experience if it sounds good to you, just have 
a backup plan.
