I am happy with the phone. It was a new unlocked phone although the shipment 
did not include a charger as was advertised. The shipping is a rip off. It 
cost me $37 and took 3 weeks to arrive. I live in Canada. Had I 
lived 100 miles to the south across the US, border, the shipping would have been 
free and I would have received it in two days. I will not buy from 
Amazon again..
