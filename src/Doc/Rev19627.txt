This phone does everything I need it to do, it is a smaller version of 
the Moto G and I have found I love Motorola phones. I hated the samsung 
galaxy s7, I am tired of proprietary everything from apple and not having access for 
things I pay for. I hate being part of the apple 'herd'. So happy with 
this phone. I dont mind amazon ads, I use amazon for a lot of things. 
very pleased. A smidge thinner and lighter and it would get 5 stars and I 
am pretty picky.
