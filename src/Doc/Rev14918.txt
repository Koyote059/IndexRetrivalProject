This phone came quickly, looked new, no scratches or anything. Worked fine for 6 months 
then the power button started sticking, or the screen would stick, or the screen would 
roll down once I started typing. Now I'm at 7 months and it's not keeping 
the charge and even when plugged in for hours charges really slowly. I have no 
recourse at this point. Just doing this review so you can be aware.
