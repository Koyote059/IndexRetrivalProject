After using 6 months of this phone, I am convinced that I made a good 
choice buying this phone. This phone give me all the capability that I want on 
an Android cell phone. It does not produce heat problem like HTC One that I 
had, but it does not have the superior display quality like HTC One. Battery life 
is decent that I could play Clash of Clan for 2-3 hrs continuously. 64Mb of 
memory is a must have hardware requirement for today's cell phone, so do not get 
a less memory model.
