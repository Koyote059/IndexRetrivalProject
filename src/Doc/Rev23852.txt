I'm not sure what to think of this. I thought I was buying a brand 
new product (the used ones are listed for less $), but after seeing that the 
box it came in was not the original box, and that the phone already had 
a screen protector on it, I am now suspicious. I am buying this phone to 
remplace my current one (same model) which I really love, but it has fallen too 
many times over the last 2 years.If this one I bought is not new, how 
do I know it hasn't been dropped? Can anyone recommend how to check whether this 
phone was already used? I have AT&T. And I paid the $269 priceThank you
