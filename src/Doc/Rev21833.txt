This phone is not ATT compatible! When I went to the store to switch it 
out the ATT SIM card does not fit this phone. The contacts can't be transferred. 
The Customer Rep had to make me a new SIM card to replace the one 
that came with the phone. I get the phone home and the Voicemail function does 
not work. Reading the instructions to go to "Voicemail Tutorial" when I get that far 
it requires a name and address to access the tutorial. Well, what name? what address? 
Not my own because the selection doesn't allow it. The SPEAKER ON/OFF button is backwards! 
And it defaults to SPEAKER ON when incoming calls come in. I do not like 
this phone and sadly have to say bought it on the reviews I read. If 
it worked properly and was compatible I may have felt differently but this phone is 
messed up.
