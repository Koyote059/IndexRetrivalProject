so i was skeptical to try BLU but ive been looking at them for their 
affordable unlocked phones for a while and decided to go for it. ive always been 
a phone geek and spent the money on the flagships so let me preface by 
saying my standards are very very high and based on the newest ios and android 
phones. that being said, this phone was ABSOLUTELY worth it. and its super convenient to 
get next day shipping on it. there are other good value powerful phones around this 
price like the one plus 2 for 350, the one plus x is solid for 
250, the zenfone 2 lines for around 200. all good for the price but this 
phone is the best sub-flagship price flagship phone.Pros:-beautiful huge amoled screen-FAST performance ( was skeptical 
but it is on par with snapdragon 810)-good fingerprint sensor-great build quality and feel--Great memory 
internal and expandable.-looks really nice-comes with cases and headphones and nfc stickersCons:-not stock android (personal 
preference)-not brand name recognition (if that matters to you, but people would expect it to 
be expensive anyway)thats it. honestly i was extremely surprised. ill keep a serious eye out 
for BLU now.
