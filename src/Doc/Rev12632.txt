There are many long reviews regarding this phone. Simply stated, it looks like an iPhone 
and many of the buttons are in the same place. It is a great alternative 
to the iPhone and what I like more is the fact that the memory is 
so EASY to expand. We purchased this phone (which is unlocked) and it was easy 
to set up with a local carrier. Our phone bills are no longer under contract 
terms and appear to be much cheaper than AT&T! Will be ordering another for my 
son. Thankful for a great phone.
