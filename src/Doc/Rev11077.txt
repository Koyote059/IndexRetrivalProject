Excellent phone for the price. There are a few caveats.1. The branded T-Mobile version of 
this phone doesn't work at all even if unlocked. The rom will reset the APN 
back to the default T-Mobile APN as soon as you exit and save it. It's 
a firmware issue.I use mine on NET10 and you have to select T-Mobile as the 
carrier to get 4G. You also have to set up a custom APN per NET10 
instructions. I'm sure similar steps will be necessary for other carriers.2. If you intend to 
websurf, play hi-def 3D games, stream movies, or shoot videos you will definitely need to 
purchase additional batteries. I use an EZO 3500 w/cover and can play about 8-10 hrs.3. 
Load the LG support tool on your PC and update the product.Awesome phone for the 
price. Don't drop it ;-)
