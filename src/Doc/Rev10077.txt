This is a nice sturdy phone, looks to hold a decent charge, and it arrived 
in a timely manner. this is a good phone if you want just that is 
tough and good for calling and texting that's about it. I'm OK with that because 
that's what i bought a phone for.One complaint; I have to drive to the nearest 
city to find a corporate store to get a "flash update" for some programming fix 
I can not longer automatically download through my phone (this is inconvenient), just so I 
can download apps, music and ringtones. My local provider is Verizon.
