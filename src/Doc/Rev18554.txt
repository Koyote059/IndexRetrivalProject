With less than one month using the smartphone I am very happy with it.Up to 
date my only 3 observations are: 1) Not prepared to read pen-drives which is not 
mentioned in specifications 2) Unless I haven`t find it, there is no back-screen to go 
back to programs opened to make more fluid going to different applications that are on 
use. 3) Memory mentions 8 gb of which 4 gb are used by the system 
and from the remaining almost 4 gb, part of them are utilized by the applications 
in which you have no choice to have them or erase them. In addtion, not 
all the applications can be transferred to a micro SD. So this is important to 
know for those that love to download many apps. Out of this it works very 
nice and I use it mainly for work purposes.
