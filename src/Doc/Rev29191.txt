Seems like a nice device but the sound quality is bad, worse than the 3 
year old phone I replaced. Unless I talk at the tiny mic opening at the 
bottom of the phone, the people at the other end of the call cannot understand 
what I am saying. The clear case may partly cause this problem - or not?? 
I put a tracfone GSM sim card in - that was a mess, but eventually 
got straightened out - I hope. Don't know if I will be able to access 
the web via att - so far I have only used my wifi, which works 
perfectly. I'm obviously not a techie, so using this unlocked phone was a challenge. I 
hope I can figure out the sound quality issue - since I bought it to 
use it primarily as a phone.
