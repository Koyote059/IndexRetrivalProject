This iPhone met my expectativas 100â . I bought the internacional unlocked version to use 
it in Argentina and it works perfectly well.I had some doubts before purchasing it because 
i had'nt heard much about this brand, but it is a sophisticated device, and it 
has erything i need and more. I find my iPhone similar to the iPhone 6 
in it's esthetic and because it is so easy to use, and also the fact 
that you can't open it's back to remove the battery,or add a memory card (both 
of which i don't need). Also you change the sim card by opening a slot 
on the side with a pin,just like an iphone, only less than half the price 
, but still as pretty AND much more original
