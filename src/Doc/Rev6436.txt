I bought it for my girlfriend and she has had nothing but problems with it, 
we play a game called torn and often iot takes 5-8 mins just to load 
and its an online game, go figure! It kicks her off a lot! why that 
is i'm not completely sure. we use hangout to talk and it also takes time 
to load and the kicking off does not seem as bad. She can go on 
amazon with out a problem it seems so perhaps it loads in a different way 
or faster loading again i'm not sure, i will get here to post here as 
well so she can her story in her own way.Shes told me that its very 
slow and she is a heavy user so its definitely not a phone for that. 
Another thing is she tried to get it hooked up and some providers said they 
don't hook up with BLU ,why im not sure but as the info becomes available 
i will update this review. we will be returning it as i have gotten her 
a different phone.Been a bad experience all round.
