I thought this was an amazing phone when I first got it. Honestly, its a 
piece of crap. When it sends text messages, it freezes after and you have to 
slide the keyboard up and down to get it unfrozen. Sometimes itll restart by itself 
if youre multitasking or if a task is working it too much. DO NOT BUY 
THIS PHONE. This is really not worth the money. I bought it as a replacement 
phone and I much have rather bought a fifteen dollar phone compared to this one. 
Mine also a few weeks ago decided that it was only going to charge when 
it wanted too. I just wanted a new phone so I didnt listen to the 
reviews at first, wish I wouldnt have made that mistake. Dont make the same mistake 
I made, you'll def regret it.
