I bought this phone for my elderly parent. He has At&t, I did put the 
SIM card from his At&t phone in the Jethro, it worked. The only Problem he 
was having was dropped calls. He would receive or make a phone call and the 
phone would hang up on the person on the other line. I'm asking for a 
refund. It wasn't his carrier, it's the phone. He had 3 or 4 bars when 
the phone calls took place.
