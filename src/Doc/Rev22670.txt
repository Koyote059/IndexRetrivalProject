the delivery was timely, the packaging was low grade,came in a large mailing envelope, box 
was crushed.The quality of the phone was poor at best. The phone was refurbished. I 
an Extravert,but damaged it, so I am familier with the phone, the phone was poor 
quality. I tried to contact the mailer on several occasions, but could never get anyone 
to answer my call. So I mailed it back. It does have a 30 day 
money back gaurentee. So I am waiting for a refund. I thought I could save 
some $, but ended up purchasing a new phone from Verizon.
