the touch on this phone hardly works you have to press very hard and the 
front screen is loose was not a good purchase. Phone also freezes whenever I make 
or receive calls back panel cannot close properly and whenever it freezes I have to 
remove the battery and replace it for it to start working again and then it 
takes about ten minutes to start back up
