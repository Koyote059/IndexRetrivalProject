Not going to go over every detail of the phone as there are plenty of 
reviews that have already done this.Phone works great, the pure Android 6.01 experience is really 
nice. Build quality of the phone is good, I like how bright the screen is 
out doors and the finger print sensor on the back works brilliantly.Now to my only 
gripe...the front facing speaker which handles sound play back (youtube, music, speaker phone, etc..) is 
absolutely terrible. Probably one of the worst speakers I've ever heard. I know phone speakers 
are not generally the best quality but this is worse than my $79 Blu phone 
I use as a beater. To be honest before buying I read reviews that stated 
the 5X speaker was not very good, but I was surprised at how bad it 
actually is. It sounds like it is playing in a tin can with a t-shirt 
thrown over it. Shame on LG!Because of this I'd rate the phone a 3 out 
5. If it had a little better speaker, not even stereo, just DECENT, I'd give 
it a 4.5 out of 5. I'm on the edge of returning because of just 
how bad the speaker sounds. I've had phones under $100 that sound better.
