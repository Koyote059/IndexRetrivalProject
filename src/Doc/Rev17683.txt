At bottom page of downloading a map with free navigation [...], a charge for transferring 
any amounts of data over-the-air should be collected by any phone network. Without a data 
plan, these providers automatically charge transferring data per kilobyte as a basic included feature. In 
addition, any Nokia applications should link directly to the main browser of service network on 
the phone as a default without any exchange. As a result, a charge should be 
counted on the phone bill when starting an up-to-date of a firmware or downloading a 
new application over-the-air.Final words, using Wi-Fi without any charge is only when I already controlled 
it with the following steps (while I do not need a data plan):1. select Connectivity,2. 
select Wi-Fi/WLAN (on second line because the default network is on the first line),3. select 
and connect an IP name (already knowing its WEP),4. select Starting Browser within the above 
IP to surf the web by hitting it after connected. The data transferring onto the 
phone at this time is not through the phone Network.(If going out of this path 
in order to select an internet global icon on menu, this action will turn OFF 
the already connected Wi-Fi instead of turning ON the default network with an automatic charge).5. 
ALWAYS make sure to select Disconect WI-Fi (on the same path). Indeed, on the Network 
browser is a must.One more thing, a GPS device unit is the best, and it 
is completely free for any things. It is also fast, easy, and more technology. A-GPS, 
one of applications on the phone causes spending more money because of transferring data over 
the air and through the phone Network.
