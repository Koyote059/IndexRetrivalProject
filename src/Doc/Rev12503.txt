Excellent smartphone for discerning people who want the very best features and user experience.Comes factory 
unlocked and compatible with all major US carriers (Both GSM and CDMA) and with complete 
US Warranty. Zero bloatware. Beautiful silver design looks stunning and will grab everyone's attention. As 
soon as I inserted the SIM card, it automatically installed all special features from my 
carrier (Supports Wi-Fi calling & Hotspot from T-Mobile).I bought this device after extensive research to 
upgrade my aging Galaxy Note 2 smartphone. The Galaxy S7 Edge has arguably the best 
camera among flagship smartphones, water resistant, excellent battery life, access to all apps and content 
in Google Play Store, Amazon App Store, and Galaxy App Store. The user interface is 
very customizable thanks to free and premium themes in Samsung's store and custom launchers. You 
can extend storage space up to 256 GB via SD Card (Pro Tip: Get the 
best possible SD card in order to be able to record hours of crisp 4K 
video footage).If you're on the fence between this and another flagship smartphone (I was looking 
at the iPhone 7), what will win you over is the amount of productivity and 
creativity that is possible with this device due to unparalleled multitasking features and sheer computing 
power. Try doing two things at once on an iPhone and you will be sorely 
disappointed, maybe Google Pixel is a contender in this department.
