The phone in general is really good (atleast for my requirments) and I really enjoyed 
having it. The reason I'm giving 1 star is because the phone I received was 
with a defective headphones/microphone jack, particullarly, the microphone channel didn't work. Also the battery was 
dying incredibly fast(like less then 2 hours of usage) and the battery indicator (software idk) 
was not working properly, giving me false readings on how much % of battery I 
have left, thus battery saver not activating when it should. As I said perfect model, 
this LG G3, sadly, a bad delivered phone.
