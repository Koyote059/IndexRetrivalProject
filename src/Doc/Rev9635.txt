The device came with scratches on the screen there was no password given so I 
cannot restore phone. The earbuds that came with device sounds as if you are using 
a.m. radio, the charger is loose and have to be wiggled around to charge and 
the BIGGEST LIE is saying it can get online but all I get is syntax 
error or cannot find a secure connection. The auto predict on the Tex only works 
in Chinese or Japanese I am unsure which.This is a 2 star device only because 
you get video and picture capabilities which one can't complain about the quality due to 
it being a $30 device, if these 2 items were not present I would rate 
it a -2 stars. I suggest one not to by this watch unless you just 
want one.Ken xin da is a better product for around the same price!!This review was
