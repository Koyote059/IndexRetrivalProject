Love it. It's awesome for a $200 phone! It is waterproof. It works with any 
network that uses Sim cards. It does get warm when the processor gets going like 
other reviews state, doesn't affect operation. Camera is okay. The warranty is badass. The screen 
cracked and they replaced it immediately.
