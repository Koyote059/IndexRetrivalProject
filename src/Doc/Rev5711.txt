Not what I was expecting, makebsure you read eveything. I wanted to use a mirco 
sd card but the phone wont take it just dual sim, says sd on one 
of the slots but doesn't recognize it and can't be added.in the settings. Just saving 
it if I break my phone while waiting on something better and holds an sd.card.
