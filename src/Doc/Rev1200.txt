Good stuff! Glad I'm not at the mercy of AT&T. Just need to call customer 
service on Monday to find out about Lollipop update. I also liked that Blu installed 
screen protector for me. I have no patience for that.***Update 9/13/2015*** Called customer service this 
morning, reached a pleasant person without a wait. I explained that I am having issues 
with Bluetooth connectivity with my Moto 360. He acknowledged that Blu is aware of problem 
and have a fix for it. He said fix will come via OTA at the 
end of the month also Lollipop 5.0 update will hopefully be at end of the 
month.
