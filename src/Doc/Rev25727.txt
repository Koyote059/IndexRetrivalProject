Great phone at an attractive price. I am a previous Sony user, and was always 
fascinated by their designs. But their performance was never really up to the mark and 
buying a Sony phone somehow felt like a compromise. But this phone has the goods 
to compete in a fiercely competitive market, with a design that strikes out.Most reviews online 
say good things about the phone's camera and overall performance, but warn about the battery 
and low audio output over the speaker. So regarding the battery, I am not a 
heavy user so it's lasting a day on full charge right now. But it does 
drain fast if you are gaming or browsing high quality content. People with heavy usage 
would need to have their charger around. And I also did the software upgrade upon 
receiving the phone to resolve the batter issue.The speaker volume is good enough for me, 
and I believe most users should be comfortable with it. Sound Quality is specially good, 
and output over the earphone is impressive too.
