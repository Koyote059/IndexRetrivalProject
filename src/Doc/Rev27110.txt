Update: everything was fine untill i started using the camera on this phone when i 
went outing. I wasnt able to take video for more than 5 mins, it got 
sooo hot and stuck, wasnt able to use the phone untill the temperature dropped. Tried 
3 times using the camera under diff circumstances, it gets stuck whenever it gets hot, 
totally unusable, Just returned it.! Disappointment from motorola/lenovo!#######Fingerprint sensor is very cool and works everytime 
perfectly! Performance is optimum and though its weightless, feels little chunkier than expected. Over all 
a great buy for $250(Amazon limited time deal $50 off with NO ads) - 64GB 
, 4GB RAM.
