So, I love the form factor, and the idea of having near full functionality in 
a phone this size. There are some serious issues with usability on this phone though. 
The screen has poor touch sensitivity near the corners, browser app displaces too much of 
the page with bars to be usable, the battery indicator has no bearing on how 
much battery life you actually have, the external buttons protrude too much and are sensitive( 
thought pocket dialing was thing of the past). On a positive note it does have 
better battery life than expected. Fun toy, but it just doesn't work for me.
