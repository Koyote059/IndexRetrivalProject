7 Months User ReviewAs I have never heard of the BLU brand, I was quite 
hesitant to make the order, however, after 7 months of usage, the Blu Vivo 5 
is holding up well and prove that it is an excellent cell phone for my 
everyday needs. If you want an affordable product that looks good, is not costing your 
rent, and still gives solid performance, this is the phone.Design: 8/10. The design is simple 
yet pleasure to look at. If you are very picky then I would say the 
material kinda feel cheap at the back. It is nothing spectacular compare to the newest 
Iphone or Samsung. However if I told my non-geek friends that I purchase this for 
$500, they would probably believe. The phone is quite light, personally I have no trouble 
holding it for a long time.Battery: 7/10. As a geek, I read and surf the 
internet a lot: from news, Reddit, to eBook. I generally spend 2-5 hours everyday reading 
or emailing from the phone. After work, I put about 2 hours of music (during 
my work out). The BLU Vivo would normally last the whole day and have around 
15% - 30% left before I go to bed. As far as my 7 months 
go by, the battery has not yet to show sign of deteriorate.Performance: 7/10. The Blu 
Vivo does not have much power for heavy gaming or newest tech like finger printing, 
eye recognition so if you are into that then I would suggest to look for 
some where else. Everything from reading, watching YouTube, to surfing, using normal app is smooth 
and I only have very few moments when the phone gets small lag.Durability: 9/10. I 
am too lazy to put on the screen protector. However since this phone has a 
Gorilla 3 glass, it is resistant to scratch. Seven months in with a couple drops, 
the phone has no scratch and is good as new. (I do use the cheap 
plastic case they provide though)Camera: 3/10. If there is a catch then it would be 
the horrible camera the phone has. The pictures I took from the Blu Vivo 5 
would be bland and sometimes my face would look like a potato due to the 
low resolution.Value: 9/10. If you are into a lot of gaming, or photography, then stay 
away. For a casual user like me who just need a phone for reading, call, 
message, and other simple stuffs, this phone is perfect for its price. It has large 
screen, looks good, feels like a high-end product, and has a decent battery.
