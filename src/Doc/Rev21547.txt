I'm super impressed with this phone. I did a lot of research after being a 
Samsung guy for many years. I just couldn't justify paying crazy high prices for unlocked 
phones anymore. Despite some of the cons listed I finally decided to go with the 
Honor 8. I am not disappointed.You can feel the quality. I'm upgrading from a Galaxy 
S5 and you can really feel the difference with the Honor's aluminum body from the 
plastic S5.The phone is super fast, has two great cameras, great battery life (with pretty 
quick charging), amazing speaker, MicroSD slot, NFC and every other feature I loved with the 
S5. Plus this phone comes with Android Marshmallow, which has some really great new features.Because 
of the reviews I read, I was prepared for the EMUI, which is their tweaks 
to the Android OS. People are not wrong - if you are used to stock 
Android, the EMUI apps are not great but a few minutes in the Play Store 
fixed that and the phone allows you to replace the default applications with no hassle. 
It came with a few preloaded apps that I didn't want but they were easily 
deleted. Not the same bloatware that most phones come with.Also, the reviews that suggest you 
buy a case immediately are not wrong. This phone has a super slick surface that 
slides out of your hand and will literally slide off of a desk or table.My 
one annoyance right now is that I am unable to plug the phone into my 
computer and transfer files without installing their installed software. I'm trying to find a workaround 
but it's a minor inconvenience considering how much I like the phone. The sim and 
microSD slots are also a bit hard to get to as you have to use 
a tiny pin tool (included) to pop open the slot.An unlocked Samsung S7 is $549 
and the Honor 8 was only $319 so I saved a lot of money and 
got what I think is an amazing deal. I would recommend this phone with no 
hesitations.
