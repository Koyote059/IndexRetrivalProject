The phone was bought refurbished and worked just as fine as new. It was passed 
on to my kid after my wife used it for a year. it was a 
great phone and served us well in all aspects (phone, camera, apps etc). As with 
many android phones, the apps/os sometimes become slow but the issue happens only occasionally. Great 
phone which you can buy at a great bargain if you don't want the extra 
power available in the latest smartphones. Great for general surfing, calling and taking family pictures.
