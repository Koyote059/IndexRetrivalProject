I love this phone! The size is perfect. It fits in my pocket just fine. 
The ability to record in 4k is really cool and the quality of the video 
seems very very nice, even when just played back on the phones display. The display 
is very sharp and gave me a headache for a day or two but I 
seem to have adjusted now. Apps load very fast. I am using the At&t nano 
sim through straight talk and everything is working just fine.The only downside so far is 
the camera loads fairly slow. My boyfriends iPhone 6 loads the camera and takes six 
photos by the time this phone loads and takes one. Other than that I am 
overall pleased with the phone.
