I bought this phone planning on using it during a visit to Beijing China. Getting 
a sim was somewhat of an adventure but I was able to get a sim 
for voice and texting and the phone worked well. The GPS was particularly solid and 
since I had downloaded maps before I left; I was able to get wherever I 
wanted to go. Once I was back in the US, I put a T-Mobile sim 
in and got on the T-Mobile 30 minutes for $3 plan so I can use 
this as a spare phone.
