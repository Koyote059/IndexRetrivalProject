Cell phone is ok, but the original box was open... Can I really be sure 
that cell phone is new? Hard to say... The other bad thing is the charger: 
It's for UK socket... Does it come with an adapter? Ohh yea, but it's useless, 
because it's from european socket to US socket... UK is in europe, but that doesn't 
mean, all them have the same electrical system... You open the box and don't see 
that the adapter won't work!!! Unbelieve
