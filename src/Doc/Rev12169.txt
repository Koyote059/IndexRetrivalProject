Preorder at $80 was the best deal LOL!I bought this phone for my mother and 
it is perfect because quadcore duocore ram screen means nothing to her, only thing matter 
is smooth usability and battery life. I personally tested this for two weeks just to 
make sure it is ok before handing it over to my mother.UI/GeneralFirst of all this 
phone is very smooth since it is running on kitkat, which is optimized for low 
end devices; I highly discourage people from updating this phone.The UI runs perfect multitasking web 
browsing is smooth with the quad-core mediatek processor. Games like beach buggy, rebuild 3 and 
others all run just as smooth as my nexus 5! However some stuttering is noticeable 
compared to my nexus 5.Battery2950mAH battery! The battery life is insane! The 720P screen and 
slower processor is a very big contributor to battery life. I went to my morning 
class with 100% ~9AM and at ~8pm the phone is at 50%! And I used 
this phone heavily (text, games, web). I finally killed the battery after video chatting continuously 
for 2 hrs after that.ScreenIt's ONLY 720p, however in my mother's eye she cannot tell 
the difference between my 1080p nexus and this anyways... To her the bigger screen on 
the BLU is actually better... It is also a very! bright screen even at the 
lowest setting.Build QualityAt this price range the build quality definitely took a hit; the side 
buttons feel a bit flimsy (wiggle), the case that comes with the phone should definitely 
be on all the time otherwise normal wear will destroy those buttons fast.CONonly bad thing 
I found about this device so far is the touch screen, it is not as 
sensitive as my nexus 5. Sometimes it require a harder tap compare to my nexus. 
Also very importantly the touch screen goes into derp mode if it is touched while 
plugged in. I believe this is a grounding issue related to cheaper capacitive screen, so 
usage while charging will not yield optimum touch experience.
