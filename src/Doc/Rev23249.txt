I bought this phone for my grandmother because of the size of the screen and 
the easy to use features that ship with every LG Phone. My grandmother is very 
happy with the clarity of the screen and the size. Also the stylus helps her 
navigate the phone very easily. Battery life is pretty good compared to other phones and 
the fact that is unlocked was the deal breaker for us. I'll recommend this product 
to anyone.
