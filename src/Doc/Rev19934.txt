The actual phone is great however the ones i got from this seller is questionable. 
I originally purchased the phone from another seller. It was great but i accidentally dropped 
it in water and it died. I decided to go with this seller for a 
replacement phone. Some of the apps kept crashing and eventually stopped working. Then, the phone 
just died and I couldn't charge it. This is just after 6 mths of use!!!! 
I purchased a replacement phone from this seller and the phone won't even charge before 
that the battery time was very short. I've had the phone less than a week. 
I think this company is selling defective phones so before....and note that they offer no 
warranty!
