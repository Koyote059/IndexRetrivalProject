Overall great phone, thin, light, fast but if you looking for the phone that looks 
expensive then that phone is not for you, that phone looks really cheap, maybe under 
$50 si nobody will never even notice that phone in your hands, the other thing 
I don't like about this phone is battery, you can't leave the charger home, this 
phone drinks battery juice, by let's say 11 o'clock my battery us 100% and by 
5pm it's only 60% and during that time I only check my Facebook page for 
about 5 minutes and check few times my email, so most if the time my 
phone remains in my pocket, I can't imagine what would happen if I would watch 
videos or would listen to the music, the battery would die in a few hours, 
so if you don't mind to carry a charger with you all the time and 
charge your phone 1000 of times a day then that battery problem is not the 
issue for you but for me it's a big big deal! So don't waste your 
money if you just like me and don't like the issues I described above!
