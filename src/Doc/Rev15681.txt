I bought two of these phones, one for me and my niece, My niece's phone 
started moving super slow and then the battery wouldn't charge after three months. She had 
to buy a new one. And mine didn't even last 8 months and now I 
have a Ghost Screen. it mirrors all my apps and I can't use it for 
anything but to make a call. Don't buy these phones you will regret it.Update I 
sent one phone in I had to pay 12$ to mail it to get fixed, 
I only sent one phone because the other ones warranty ran out. The screen pixels 
were gone on this phone, I got the phone back fast, But now all my 
apps, and tabs, disappear every time I click on them, I have to reset the 
phone for them to all show again on the phone. and it took about an 
hour before my phone would start charging after I plugged it in. So I learned 
my lesson I bought two of these. Now its time to save up for real 
phones.
