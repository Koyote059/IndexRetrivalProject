I had the J7 that i broke and decided to get this one because it 
was cheaper and basically the same. I love it. It is still at a decent 
size (not too small) and the camera quality is pretty good. This phone only works 
with an american sim card though so probably wouldn't work for someone outside of the 
US or who is thinking to use some other country's sim card. But overall, I 
really love this phone.
