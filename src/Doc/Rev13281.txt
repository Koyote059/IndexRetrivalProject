Did a lot of research to purchase my first smartphone. HTC One X consistently got 
excellent reviews on all sorts of sites. I needed an unlocked phone that I could 
bring with me when I travel to Europe for a few months next year. The 
phone itself is great - chic, good sound, easy touchscreen, etc. I don't find using 
the Android system on the phone all that intuitively easy - I'm still figuring out 
a lot of the settings etc. And because I don't have a regular contract with 
a service provider (using T-Mobiles pay as you go plan), I'm on my own to 
figure out how things work. So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as someone's first phone 
- I'm sure techies love it though. I was wary of Apple for a few 
reasons, but mainly because I couldn't bring an iPhone to Europe. So even though Apple 
would have much better customer support and help figure out things, I went with the 
Google phone. But I'm pleased with this purchase and it's a great phone with terrific 
features. I did run into issues with the phone recognizing a SIM card - which 
apparently might be a hardware problem, but it was an easy fix.
