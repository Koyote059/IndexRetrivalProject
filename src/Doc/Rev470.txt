This phone is excellent. I gave it 4 stars because of the battery, and that 
can be easily rectified. At first I thought the sound was bad, but noticed the 
plastic was still on the back. (LOl). After I took off the plastic, it was 
good to go. The camera is good. There is nothing to complain about. I would 
definitely recommend this phone to family and friends. The price is good also. This is 
my second Posh phone, and as long as I buy Android phones, I will definitely 
buy Posh, especially this model.
