I got this phone when it was cheaper than it is now ($86) and let 
me tell you, this is one f the best value for money items I've ever 
seen. I was going to buy it just to experiment with roms and other nerdy, 
androidy stuff. But after using it? I think this could be used as a daily 
item. The FM radio feature is pretty cool. Audio quality isn't bad at all, and 
the speaker's front facing position makes it better. The screen's ppi isn't very big, but 
images and UI elements are quite smooth. peaking of which, the whole user experience is 
smooth. Probably thanks to the gpu not having to manage upwards of 3 million pixels 
like my note 4, probably due to the 1.2 ghz dual core (not beefy, but 
powerful enough), and partly due to the fact that this phone uses the stock (well, 
pretty much) UI. Durability? Well, I'd prefer not to drop it, but I think it'll 
survive some small fumbles. The device feels pretty solid in hand. The only downer is 
the camera. At 5 mp, it's a good sensor, but with no flash or autofocus, 
this phone isn't a good choice for a night-owl or anyone who likes to take 
close-ups with superb detail. And while some might not like the weight (it's not particularily 
light), I find it nice, as it adds a premium feel to it. I will 
update this review (maybe) once I root the device and run some benchmarks, and find 
what day to day usage is like.(Update): Well, I ended up returning it after a 
couple of days because I got a bootloader-locked version. Ended up buying an identical version, 
but right from Motorola. It's rooted, and while it wasn't super easy, it was worth 
it. I've got it running a light weight version of the stock rom, with little 
build tweaks.
