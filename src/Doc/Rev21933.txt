I loved this phone but the warranty is poor. I wear my phone constantly on 
a belt holder and apparently the phone got some moisture on it. I am not 
talking about getting wet but moisture from day to day activities. Apparently this phone has 
a indicator in it that turns redish/pink when exposed to moisture and the warranty is 
void.I ended up having to buy a brand new phone because Motorola would not replace.Needless 
to say I did not but a RAZR. I treated the phone the same as 
I do all my phones and have never had one quit due to this before 
or after the RAZR. In my opinion this is poor design/poor support and I will 
not spend the money for this phone again even though I love the functionality and 
setup of this unit.
