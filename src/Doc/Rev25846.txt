I was looking for my mother a new phone as her Moto G was causing 
her multiple issues. I decided to give this one a go because of the price 
point and Lollipop update.I am SO impressed! She is already enjoying this far better than 
the Moto G and the pink color is pleasant and not too bold.the phone runs 
like a champ and the 4G is snappy on her Cricket Wireless service!Great job, Blu! 
I'm loyal to my BlackBerry Passport but if I ever decided to tinker with an 
Android device for fun I would try a Blu product!
