Easy to use. wifi is great, no data plan is required.UPDATED:After 5months, dropped many times, 
this phone is still working perfectly. I use it for work and play. Lots of 
memory for pictures and downloads. Camera/video takes good pictures. Easy to download to home computer.My 
children have downloaded many games that eat alot of memory, and it still has good 
speed.This phone is easy to navigate and use. Still learning all of the functions as 
I need them. I AM NOT TECHNOLOGY FRIENDLY.
