I love this phone. I thought it would be too basic and unattractive, but it's 
quite nice all around. I really enjoy the vanilla-ish Android experience after using phones with 
manufacturer/carrier skins, alterations, and bloat. You can tell that Google wants this phone to work 
well as an example of the "Android experience". With no muss or fuss I had 
wifi tethering working in about 2 minutes, no mucking about with rooting, custom roms, etc. 
I'm using Airvoice's $30/month plan and it works great after configuring the APN settings (found 
on Airvoice's site). Definitely recommended for a budget smartphone. Will probably buy another for my 
wife who is currently using a Noka Lumia 520.*Edit: One small thing I don't like 
about this phone. The camera's minimum focus distance is quite large (>30cm) and therefore scanning 
barcodes for comparison shopping is not really feasible. You may get lucky, but in general 
it will be frustrating. Considering upgrading to the Moto G and giving this phone to 
my wife. Still love the device for the price/performance ratio.
