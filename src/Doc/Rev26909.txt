So far so good! I ordered this phone and it was delivered two days later. 
They said it could be up to a week but it arrived very fast. Looks 
brand new and seems to work just fine. I will get the SIM card installed 
today and if everything goes according to plan I will come back and update my 
review to 5 stars. I had a phone just like this one for about two 
years which I accidentally destroyed last weekend. They don't make 'em like this anymore. They 
are all "phablets" now, which I cannot stand. If you want a decent smartphone that 
you can use with one hand, this is an excellent choice and I have been 
quite pleased with this seller.
