I just love the Otterbox Defender Series cell phone cases. I have purchased an Otterbox 
Defender for every cell phone I have had and have recommended one to everyone I 
know. These cases live up to all they claim. They are easy to put on 
and look great. The best part... they protect my cell phone so well. I have 
dropped my phone on to the concrete ground from a distance of about 5 feet, 
landing right on the corner of the phone (the most vulnerable spot) and all the 
phone did was bounce. NO screen cracks and everything worked great. I trust this case 
so much that I no longer take time to research other cases to see how 
they would compare. I just automatically buy Otterbox Defender!I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy s5. 
I did look at the other Otterbox case styles (commuter series, etc.), but decided that 
the Defender still provided the best protection. It has three layers of protection including the 
screen cover. I feel it can still fit into my purse nicely and in my 
back pocket even though the S5 is such a larger phone.
