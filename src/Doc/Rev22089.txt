I like this phone a lot - would have given it five stars but the 
very left portion of the screen is not responsive to touch. I bought it used 
and the seller did not disclose this problem to me which is why I take 
away a star. Fortunately it doesn't impact the use of the phone very much. Makes 
candy crush a little hard to use when trying to clear items on the left 
column though!I've used many android phones with this being my first iPhone. It's a nice 
break from Android. Battery life has been exceptional for me. Reception seems good too. It's 
strange going to a smaller phone when almost all of the phones now are getting 
bigger, but I like the size of it.
