setting up a new phone is a pain. I used the smart switch app and 
it went well. Still have to remember all the passwords. But I have it setup.All 
is well. One problem is the phone will not upgrade from Android 5 to Android 
6.Not sure why and who is at fault. I need to get in touch with 
T-Mobile to try and fix. If this cannot be correct I'll return the phone.If it 
can be fixed I'll upgrade to 5 stars.
