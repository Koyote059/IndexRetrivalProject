The phone appears to be working just fine for now... Broke the screen when it 
was dropped.Took the phone to the Apple store only to be informed that this is 
is not an Apple phone. They told us that the blue casing is not apple, 
and that the screen all the way to the inner workings were not apple and 
that they would not touch it for repair etc. It appears this is a knock 
off. It is working so far but for how long. This seller advertised this as 
a new Apple phone- Buyer beware.
