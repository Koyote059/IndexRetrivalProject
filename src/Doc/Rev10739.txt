I had the Iphone 5 and desperately needed an upgrade. I grew tired of being 
an apple customer after 2 years. So I switched back to android. I love the 
Galaxy 6 Edge it's wonderful and the camera is awesome. The package came with everything 
you see in the pictures and it even came in a day early! I'm so 
pleased with this phone. Not too big and easy to handle and its so sleek. 
I love the notification features of the Egde.
