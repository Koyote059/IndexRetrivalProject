This has been so upsetting. I first started this phone 2 days ago. I noticed 
it getting hot, very hot. Then then the screen would not register commands, then the 
screen began spinning. I was stunned I couldn't believe I bought this from Amazon. It 
continued to flicker, flash and spin for some time. I am most unhappy. I was 
very exited to get this phone, then it acts like this while my sons 25.00 
Samsung from Walmart is working better than this one.
