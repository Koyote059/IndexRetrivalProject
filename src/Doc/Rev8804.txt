The phone itself seems to be great. The issue is that it was advertised as 
working with all US carriers including Verizon but that is not the case with the 
model I received. They sent the global model that works with T-Mobile and AT&T. Had 
to send it back. From the couple of days I had the Nexus 5x I 
can tell that I like the phone. Losing the bloatware Verizon apps is pretty awesome. 
The phone is a little longer than I'd like but it's hard to find a 
phone that's smaller.
