So I bought this phone to use overseas; I had to buy an unlocked phone. 
Initially I was happy with it, but then out of the blue it just stopped 
receiving network. I thought it was my sim card but it(sim card) works fine on 
other phones. So it's definitely the phone. Waste of money! Still looks brand new coz 
I took such good care of it, but it's useless:-(
