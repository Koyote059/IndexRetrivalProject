I received a defective NEW BRAND PHONE!!! I plugged it in when I just turned 
it on, and there was no light or icon to indicate that it was charging... 
and no matter how many chargers I tried, nothing happened... and now the phone has 
died completely and there is no way to recharge it as it is clearly defective!! 
This is ridiculous!!! WHAT A WASTE!!! DO NOT BUY!!!! GARBAGE!!! First time with this phone 
and its a real disappointment, especially after reading all these good reviews. SO BE AWARE!
