If you want a real review, head over to Youtube and watch MKBHD's review of 
this phone. You will know what you are getting before you buy it.From a personal 
stand point. I chose this phone for my sister and it is simply amazing. It's 
a really amazing phone one year later. I'm not a fan of LG's UI on 
android but they do add some functional tools and some other android phones are missing, 
like the ability to open the calculator on top of another app.
