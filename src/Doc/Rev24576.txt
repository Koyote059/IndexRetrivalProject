I gave it one star because the LG G3 is a very good phone, however 
the one I received WAS FACTORY LOCKED :( using the unlock access code (For LG 
G3 (D855), enter 2945#*855#) I got to the manufacture lock screen where I was greeted 
with "This phone is permanently locked and can not be unlocked" DISMISS. Amazon is handling 
the return and refund beautifully and I will be ordering a new phone thru my 
service provider.
