Just got this, and it seems to be working great. The only problem I experienced 
was it would not send or receive photo text messages, which WAS resolved after a 
call to my providers customer service. This was the "with special offers" variety, and the 
lock screen advertisements can be avoided as the photos wakes up when you lift it 
without showing the ad. It is only by pushing the power button are you sure 
to get the ads. All the pre loaded Amazon apps can be moved out of 
the way or uninstalled. A good offer for Prime customers.
