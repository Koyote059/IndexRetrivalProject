I ordered a new phone and got a used one.1- the outer box came with 
scratches. 2- the phone had scratches on the sides, the bar code at the bottom 
of the phone was partially worn. 2- the protective plastics on the sides of the 
phone were peeling off. 3- no headphones came 4-charging brick came in a used zip-lock 
bag with scratches on it. 5- the charging port flap came open with dust inside 
the charging port as if it was being used for a while, and the biggest 
whopper of all, 6- the bottom left corner of the screen was lifting off from 
the body of the phone - you could just about see inside the phone.Needless to 
say I will be returning this. Please see photos.I only gave this two stars because 
I owned this phone previously and it was good and decided to re-purchase
