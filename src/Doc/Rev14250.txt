Super easy to use interface and a really long battery life. I went two and 
a half weeks before needing to charge it. So far, my only complaints are that 
it's not as easy to open as some other phones I had in the past, 
and people on the other end often have a hard time hearing me when I 
talk. Besides that, the radio works well and it's just super simple. Typing in the 
text messaging app has no auto completion and you have to do the old fashion 
555 to get an L.
