Great iPhone 5s. Takes very decent pictures for such a tiny camera and lens. I 
like the HDR which helps even out the lighting. But, it still not as good 
as a dedicated digital camera, but still very convenient, and good enough to take good 
snap shots for posting online, which is a very convenient and smooth procedure. Screen looks 
good and does not scratch easily. So, I am very happy with it!
