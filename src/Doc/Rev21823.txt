I've been very impressed with this phone. It was unlocked and easily setup to run 
on a my carrier (t-mobile). Aside from just being good looking and very quick to 
change between apps and programs, it had pretty decent volume for a phone. Certain greater 
than previous generation LG phones. But what really makes it stand out is its camera. 
I do photography as a hobby and have certainly geeked out at the extreme depth 
of field shots you can when shooting up close. The focus is sharp and quick, 
and I find my shots turning out much better than my girlfriend's (an iPhone 5).I 
highly recommend it for anybody who puts their camera first when making their phone purchases.
