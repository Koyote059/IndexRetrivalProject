The concept behind this is great but design wasn't fully thought out.. Cable for the 
Apple Watch is a bit to firm to fit in its designed in pocket so 
line sticks up or if forced down doesn't allow the Apple Watch charger to sit 
correctly and sticks out.. The USB port though looks nice is very weak.. Great for 
your phone not for a iPad even if you plug the USB to a higher 
powered ipad outlet.. iPad would take around 16 hrs for a full charge.. The under 
pocket to hide the iPhone wire also doesn't allow the line to hide in completely 
unless your wrap your wire very tight ( not good ) the remedy to that 
would be to get the shortest iPhone wire from Apple... Here are the facts... I 
gave it 2 stars only bc it is nice but to get to work correctly 
you would need another very short iPhone wire ( an added expense ) and you 
would maybe have to glue your apple charger to the docks so the wire sits 
in its spot and the actual charging spot doesn't rotate on you.. Things to consider 
to have this completely functional
