I have had 2 of these phones in the last 2+ months. Both failed.1st one: 
turned off randomly. VZ navigator worked for about 2 weeks, then the GPS stopped working. 
I contacted the vendor (Applewireless) and they replaced it within 10 days.2nd one: within the7-10 
days it turned off randomly and will not hold a charge. I charge it, get 
1 text, battery is dead and it shuts down. I plug it in and it 
says battery is fully charged!Hoping Applewireless comes through on a refund! Due to a family 
emergency, I need a working phone now, so I went to the Verizon store to 
get one.
