I was looking for an unlocked cell phone for my son for Christmas. I searched 
several sites and spent at least two weeks reading product reviews. Not all unlocked phones 
are compatible with my cell phone service, so it was important that I get this 
right. I liked the appearance and options this phone offered and because I trust Amazon, 
I decided to buy it.My son loved the phone the minute he opened it and 
it worked perfectly. Two days later, however, it became unregistered. I contacted our service provider 
and the customer service representative thought it might be the phone. That made no sense 
to me since it had worked for two days. She brought a supervisor into it, 
and after a couple of downloads to the sim card, the phone turned on and 
has been working beautifully ever since.The phone has a one year manufacturer's warranty. I hope 
that we never have to take advantage of it, and at this point in time 
I would have to say that this phone was an excellent deal for the price.
