This phone is just amazing! The design is gorgeous, the camera is excellent, everything just 
runs perfectly. The battery lasts more than 48h easily with intense use, in days that 
I don't use it very much I can go 72h without a recharge. The underwater 
thing really works, the headphones are pretty good and the speakers are also good, I 
think that they are not great because of the water-resistant revetment but Its not bad 
at all.For those like me, who like smaller phones, it won't be a disappointment, the 
cell fits in your hand and you can do pretty much everything using just one 
hand.
