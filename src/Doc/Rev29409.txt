Bought this phone "used" from an Amazon vendor. I suspect someone had traded up, after 
using it for a very short time. It looked virtually brand new when I received 
it. The phone had a lot of T-Mobile bloatware, (most of which I removed), but 
it was unlocked and for about 2 months I used it on my Canadian GSM 
network. I recently switched to Wind Mobile, another network here in Canada, and it also 
works well there.Now to the phone itself. This is the first "smartphone" I've owned that 
i can actually read the screen outdoors in sunlight. There is bit of "washout" on 
a bright day, but I am able to read my E-mails and have no trouble 
dialing a phone number or seeing the apps when I bring them up. The built 
in speakers have proven quite useful during telephone calls as I have a bit of 
a hearing deficit and this allows me to hear my callers more clearly. Reception is 
good, and the 5.5" screen is about the right size for me. I've taken a 
few photos and they've turned out quite well. Don't do a whole lot of video 
streaming so no comments on that aspect of the "G4." But all in all, after 
about 3 months of use, I can say it was a very satisfactory purchase from 
Amazon.
