i got this Note 4 to replace a Note 3 with 4G (LTE), the Mobile 
itself is amazing i can only talk good about the N4, beauty full and stylish, 
high performance mobile, but no 4G really sucks, however getting a Note 4 unlocked at 
this price with no warranty, i think it was a big mistake, lets say 200usd 
mistake, mobile was delivered on time, and i am happy with the mobile, however, i 
think price was a bit high.
