The seller is good. But the product is really bad. If you search this 'BLU 
phone hangs on logo screen' in google u can see lot of blogs talking on 
this. Hanged in one month and never started back. For 50$ you can get a 
moto 3g phone and its far better than this.4G, DUAL SIM and all other specs 
might be appealing but DON'T BUY BLU phones.
