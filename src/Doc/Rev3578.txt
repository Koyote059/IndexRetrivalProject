This phone works great! It sure is an improvement over my old ASUS phone. My 
only wish is for the new Android OS to provide an easier way to delete 
email accounts. But I have everything setup just fine.If you get a case, wait until 
you have the case on the phone to capture the fingerprint settings. I like the 
way you can teach the fingerprint reader to pick up different angles from either hand. 
Also, I really like the KAPAVER case that I purchased at the same time.Overall I 
like this phone so much that I purchased a second one for my son.
