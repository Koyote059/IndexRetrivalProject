I have had this phone since June of 2009 and have had little trouble with 
it. I did buy it unlocked here off of Amazon, not sure of the company 
though. I have had occasional freezing from it, which is the only reson it didn't 
get a 5 star from me. I have read previous reviews of how it doesn't 
support internet even in 3G, or that the picture messaging does not work. I have 
used the web browser in normal service with only 2 bars before. While extremely slow, 
it does work, so I really don't know where the "not working in 3G" came 
from. Also, i have sent, and recieved Multi Media Messages (MMS) throughout my time of 
having this phone. The e-mail client and IM client also functions properly. Overall, this is 
a great phone and I highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a cheap, yet 
pleasing phone.
