It was a great phone when it arrived. However, within two weeks it started having 
charging problems. Had to wiggle the cord to get it to charge. Now, at four 
weeks it won't charge. Have tried multiple cords. I wish I had read more of 
the reviews. This seems to happen to a lot of their customers. I am on 
day two of waiting to hear back from them. So far just automail. This is 
annoying.
