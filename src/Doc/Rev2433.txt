Great phone for the price. Going from screen to screen or app to app is 
seamless. The battery life is amazing as well. My old phone, which was an HTC 
Ultimate, was bulky and drained battery even when not in use. When you are not 
using the Moto G, it seems like battery life stays about the same. So far, 
I have been using this phone on full charge for a day and a half, 
and I still have over half of my battery life! This is even with wi-fi 
being on at all times. Also, I like the alarm clock feature because it forces 
you to hold an press and icon then drag it to snooze or off. If 
you are in the market for a smartphone that does pretty much everything more costly 
phones do, I definitely suggest you buy this.
