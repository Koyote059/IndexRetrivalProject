My wife needed a case that protected the phone from accidental drops from her, and 
most importantly our toddler. This does a great job of doing that. The case is 
kind of hard to open up and install, but once you get it open and 
on the phone, it feels solid. I took off one star for the size of 
the case. It's large. It makes a big phone, even bigger. If you are looking 
for something slim, and to fit in the front pocket of your jeans... keep looking. 
It did come with a belt clip, that will never be used by my wife, 
but may add another layer of protection if dropped.
