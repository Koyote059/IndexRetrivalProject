I am so disappointed with this phone. From day one, I started experiencing dropped calls 
after about 20 seconds, and after about two weeks of use, my LCD died. I 
replaced the LCD and had the phone flashed, and flexed and nothing helped. It's currently 
packed away in the box, and I'm hoping to have it stripped down and the 
individual parts sold. If you're thinking about purchasing one, try your luck with one of 
the other models if you insist. Mine was likely refurbished according to the technician who 
worked on it, and there are probably alot more like it on the net. So, 
buyer beware.
