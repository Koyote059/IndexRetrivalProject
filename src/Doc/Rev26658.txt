This phone is all good. It hasn't given me a single problem since I bought 
it. Easy to use, excellent resolution, and very durable.I'll say that again, VERY durable. Dropped 
it by accident a couple times and there wasn't a scratch on it (thank goodness). 
All in all, I give my thumbs up for this Samsung Galaxy.
