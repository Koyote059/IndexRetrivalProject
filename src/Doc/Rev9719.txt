This phone is turning out to be my favorite cellphone. The only flaw is in 
order to get the back up button to go onto the screen, you must swipe 
upwards at the very bottom of the screen a few times to register it on 
the screen but other than that its perfect in many ways. For one its unlocked! 
Bonus! 2. It has an easy to use highly effective system with fast internet. 3. 
The screen is 6" which is perfect for viewing videos. 4. It isn't super clogged 
up with apps that I hate. Another bonus! Great phone!
