I bought the phone, at first i loved it. That was 12 hours ago. Now 
its freezing. Videos are delayed. Its freezing on me and being slow. I figured it 
was refurbished and returned before because when i got the device it had a old 
screen protector on it and they come with one that you have to put on 
it not already on there. Im returning this device and going to just buy me 
something else.
