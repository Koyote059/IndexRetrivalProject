The phone is excellent, but unfortunately the advertising is wrong. I ordered this phone but 
the description said "unlocked". This is the reason I am giving it 3 stars, because 
I received the phone, and popped in my Straight Talk sim, but was unable to 
change the APN settings to get data and mms, due to the phone being a 
carrier locked phone. My cell service works, so I could make calls and receive texts, 
but the data that I'm paying for isn't working because as I stated earlier I 
cannot change the APN settings. The strange thing is that when I inserted my sim 
I was not prompted to put in an unlocked code, but as I tried to 
change the APN settings, I noticed there was a little padlock underneath the APN already 
there, and that although I could add a new APN I could not select the 
APN I added. Now I may have to fork out some money to get this 
phone unlocked, and it's all because of misadvertisement. Also, the phone pictured in the version 
with the red accents and htc at the top, while the phone I received was 
just solid black and had the AT&T logo at the top.
