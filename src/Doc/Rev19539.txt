I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago and I hate it. I already got 
a used iPhone to use instead of this. This phone constantly froze up and operated 
very slow. It's very annoying. I have seen plenty of good reviews so maybe I 
got a bad phone. But I couldn't even type a message without the keyboard taking 
about 5 seconds to register each letter. And just scrolling thru the homescreen was very 
glitchy. This phone makes it hard to enjoy doing anything because you have to wait 
for your phone to catch up with whatever you're trying to do. I was using 
the phone with cricket and I thought crickets service was bad but I have 0 
problems with cricket on the iPhone I'm using now.PROSConstruction of the phone is greatDisplay looks
