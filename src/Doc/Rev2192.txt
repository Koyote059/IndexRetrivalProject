Love my BLU phone.I use it with my at&t "go phone" plan so it costs 
me around $10/month for all the cell phone I need. (no data, wifi only)Works very 
well, fantastic battery life, beautiful screen. Pop a 64gb micro sd card in it & 
have no storage worries.I have zero regrets in buying this phone. It does everything I'd 
want it to.I would not hesitate to buy another BLU phone. Many of my friends 
& family have them now because I'm so happy with mineUPDATEIn January there was an 
update for a battery issue. The update murdered my big orange phone, so sad!I replaced 
it with a super cheap blu advance, but it was only 4 GB, not nearly 
enough.I now have the Studio Plus(8GB) and am very happy with it.
