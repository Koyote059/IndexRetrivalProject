I purchased this phone to replace my Google Nexus 4. Though I was happy with 
the Nexus phone, after nearly 3 years the battery appeared to be deteriorating. Google's new 
phone offering is much larger and I didn't want what amounts to a Phablet. The 
Samsung Galaxy S6 is only slightly longer and very thin and light. The camera is 
superior to my old Nexus. Apps are simple and easy to locate and adjust. So 
far, the battery life is quite good, but I'm usually using only basic text, phone 
and minimal data programs.My biggest concern was whether an "international" dual sim card phone would 
be compatible with my existing StraightTalk prepaid plan in Illinois. I ordered my new NANO 
SIM card and got the phone up an running without a problem. Originally, I struggled 
with getting the phone to receive data, which is included in my carrier plan. After 
an unsuccessful call to StraightTalk tech support, I realized the problem wasn't due to inaccurate 
APN settings, but because I had not selected the installed SIM card in the settings/SIM 
card manager option.The dual SIM card feature in this phone is pretty cool. You can 
easily purchase a prepaid international SIM card if needed, and use the phone abroad. Then 
you have the option of toggling back and forth between SIM cards whenever necessary.
