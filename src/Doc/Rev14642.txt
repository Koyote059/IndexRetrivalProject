I purchased this phone from "Quality Deals Shopping Center"It was purchased on 10/30/2016 and the 
phone was shipped out next day by "Quality Deals Shopping Center" from Taichung, Taiwan with 
DHL express mail (no additional cost).I received the phone on 11/3/2016, the invoice/receipt (from authorized 
Sony Taiwan store) was also included in the package.It means you get one year warranty 
from Sony mobile in Taiwan (in case that make a difference for you).Taiwan is one 
of the biggest market for Sony Mobile and Sony usually packs extra features on their 
phone released in Taiwan compare to US (which is one of the main reason I 
decided to get one from Taiwan).Xperia XZ box is sealed as shown in the picture.This 
is a Sony F8332 phone with dual SIM and 64 GB internal storage (US version 
is only 32 GB in storage).Following are included int the box:1. Sony F8332 mobile phone2. 
Sony MH410c earphone3. Sony AC-0051-TW 2700mA USB charger4. Sony UCB20 USB type C cableSince this 
is Taiwan version of XZ, fingerprint scanner is enabled right out of box (no need 
to root like US version).Dual SIM card works well which can be easily controlled via 
settings menu.Currently I am using T-mobile nano SIM with 128GB Sandisk micro SD card which 
boast total storage to almost 200 GB.Quick speed test on the T-mobile network yields around 
36 Mbps near my home.Note: 4G+ on the screen capture is equivalent to US LTE+ 
(as other countries use 4G to indicate LTE).Xperia's OS is very close to vanilla android 
and currently XZ is on Android 6.0.1This is a solid choice if you are looking 
for a different choice compare to normal Samsung S7, LG G5 and HTC 10 (or 
even iPhone 7/7 plus for iOS)
