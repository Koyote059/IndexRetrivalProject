This phone was sold as a new unlocked phone .From the time i received this 
phone it appeared used the plastic cover had many scratches and the phone was sent 
in a piece of card stapled together with no manual remember this is supposed to 
be a new phone where is the box whih would have been part of the 
packaging of the new item .This phone was not unlocked which is the first breach 
of sale agreement and i had to communicate with seller to find out at least 
if ther was a code to unlock the phone a code was sent but the 
unlock process failed.My early communication i also indicated to the seller that the phone had 
on sms messages he indicated to me that that was done to see if the 
phone was working lol what a joke. When i took this phone to a cell 
shop with the instructions provided from the seller i was told that five calls was 
made on the phone one as far as Africa from the area codes seen on 
communicating this information i was told by the seller mthat it was impossible to know 
if any calls were made lol another joke they were made and also two bbm 
messages.I was receiving prompt communication from seller untill i indicated my intention of returning this 
phone . I am sure a full refund of my 288.47 is in order i 
was sold a product that was 1 NOT UNLOCKED 2 USED 3 DEFECTIVE
