Phone works great, but I'm still wondering... How come there's an outgoing call on my 
supposedly new device dated April 4th, 2014, even though I bought it on July, 2014... 
?? Also when the phone starts it appears the Movistar logo on full screen... So, 
I'm thinking... Wasn't it supposed to be "Factory Unlocked"?? I don't know what that is 
anymore then...
