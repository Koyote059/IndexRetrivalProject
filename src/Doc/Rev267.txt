Very good phone. What stands out is the android latest updates.But battery life is terrible! 
Ok, it charges fast, but it worth nothing if you have to recharge 2-3 times 
a day.If you don't use it too much it is good (once it don't drain 
battery while at rest), but if you turn the screen on, the clock starts ticking.
