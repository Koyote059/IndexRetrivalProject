firstly didnt receive headset mentioned amazon website customers get free headset boxthis like misleading customers 
giving false informationsecondly want say like everything phone first oneplus phone love oxygen oshaving said 
im facing minor heating issues phone still bothers didnt expect would happen oneplus hope fixed 
heard lot oneplus decided purchase new phone picked oneplus 7t rog 2battery decent drain quickly 
using dark mode helps lot saving battery even heavy usagei dont like camera phone use 
beauty mode entirely changes face look really weird samsung oppo vivo far better comes camera 
wide angle photos also come odd click objects using wide angle come well click photos 
people person front comes really bad especially selfie camera phone worse selfie camerai earlier using 
samsung s7 edge much smaller compared oneplus 7t phone big take time get adjusted phone
