The phone was in perfect shape as far as the appearance. Once I got it 
activated I had to update the iOS to be able to use iTunes and the 
Apple Store. The phone worked fast until I started taking pictures and downloaded a few 
apps. It uses more data than any other phone I've ever used. It usually takes 
me a month and a half to run out of 2gb of data but with 
this phone it took two weeks. I have even turned off a lot of applications 
from running in the background. The absolute worst thing about it is that the battery 
life with minimum usage typically last me 2 hours. God forbid I make one five 
minute phone call, it drains the battery down completely within five minutes. I usually have 
to use it plugged into the charger. It has features that I love but I 
really don't believe I will keep this phone just because of the consistent low storage 
warning, low battery life, and slow system. I wanted to return it but didn't know 
how.
