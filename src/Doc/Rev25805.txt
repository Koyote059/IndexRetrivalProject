I did not like the way the screan curves on the sides. Tempered glass and 
even regular screan protectors will not lay flat so of you do not mind using 
a phone with out any kind of screan protection on it. I also did not 
like the fact the home screan only had two places. My LG stylo has five 
and I did not like only having two. My daughter and son like theirs and 
are happy. I did not and re-activated my old phone right away. To each their 
own. So out of the three I bought I was the only one who did 
not like the lay out.
