the * button didnt work, but i paid 31 shipped, so i didnt want to 
give up that easy when i couldnt call *228 for verizon, but got it working. 
the seller left a few things out about the phones cosmetic blems, but the phone 
itself is sweet and for $31 shipped not only do you get what you pay 
for, its sharp for being a non smart phone. i got sick of replacing expensive 
phones and saving $30 a month for other things. the reason most this phone has 
such horrible reviews is due to the few crummy scam artist. take from it what 
you will.
