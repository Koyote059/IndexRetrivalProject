Most of what i use this tablet for it works good. Web browsing, watching stuff, 
and reading comic books, it works well. This is not a lightning fast tablet, nor 
is it marketed as such, but the size, screen quality, and battery life make it 
a very good value for the price. Screen may only be 720p but on a 
screen this size its not noticeable without a good zoom in, and i can easily 
get around 7-8 hours of screen on time with normal usage (brightness a little over 
1/3rd), 6-7 hours with heavier use.The cons of this device however:Storage is only 8gb, with 
only about 4.3gb available. This isnt a total dealbreaker though as you can get more 
on that one would think, though if you like to use a lot of apps 
you will have to make some sacrifices. I am able to install large media streaming 
apps, netflix, hulu, amazon video, and wwe network, in addition to a few of my 
personal "must have" apps and still have about 1.5gb available without even loading any onto 
an sd card.\The other con will not even be an issue for many. This device 
lacks mirrorcast support so you can not expand this device onto a second monitor. Secondly 
i have had a lot of issues with streaming media from the tablet to both 
chromecast and an xbox one, with the video freezing sometimes after a few seconds, others 
after as long as 40 minutes or so, though it does work properly on occassion. 
I had this issue with 2 units and never had an issue with any other 
device ive used. This will be a deal breaker for myself but wont be for 
many.All in all this is a niche device, if you want a compact device to 
use primarily to stream media, read, or something of that nature it is a great 
device, however it will not be a choice for power users.
