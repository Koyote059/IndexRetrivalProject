Such a great phone. My job keeps me going from office to the field, where 
my pda is prone to damage. The organizer, microsoft office file handler and other applications 
help my pda stay save. The interface on screen constantly shows my next scheduled task 
(synchronized to PC), just pressing a button to call it from sleep mode. The three 
configurable buttons takes you to the application you want, added to six possible selections on 
screen. Email transmitting and reception is easy, as well as web browsing.thanks
