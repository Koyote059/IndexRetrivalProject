im quite disappointed to say i order a new phone and it look like a 
refurbish phone, the battery cover look like it not for the phone, a see part 
of the side phone done getting away, i had used a pearl 8100 and a 
8320 and when loading i see blackberry or o2 but this one i seeing some 
kind of mtn not sure anyone have this problem with it, and the pre loaded 
theme not like i know of other bb phone and next time when pass had 
on the screen feeling all the edge plus it screen didnot come with a plastic 
covering like i know all new phone come with.plus i have a problem not the 
phone not reading the memory card, sometime ago i check on the inside and i 
really look used the pin that inside back of phone not corresponding with with phone 
actually used, it look like a waste of money so i vex.
