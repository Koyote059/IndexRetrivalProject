why is this phone from 2009? doesnt supposed to be actual? i ordered 2 of 
the same 3 days apart each, my surprise the first one i bought was brand 
new, the apps and everything,,,,,,,,,,,, but the second one came, from 2009 edition, the apps 
are totally different, they though because i bought 2 I was going to be an 
idiot that wont realized such a big difference,,,,, is a shame I would like my 
money back
