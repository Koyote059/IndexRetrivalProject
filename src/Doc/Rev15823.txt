So here's the low down and I'm coming through to you in every possible why 
I possibly can from the very essence of me. In the past year of Bought 
three of these blu phones one being blu studio C as my first $99.00 a 
blu life 8 xl 129.00 and last but not least a blu life xl 139.00 
with the 2 mbs ram and 16 gigs of memory!! They are absolute junk!!! If 
you want quality and something that'll last stay away from these they'll literally drive you 
insane!!! Yah you come here write a 5 star review then 2 months down the 
road you start having issues !!!!!!!!!!!!! The studio C had a mind of it's own 
starts stops freezes after two months in.. The blu life xl 2 months down the 
road would no longer charge defective receptacle and last but not least the life xl 
think the damn thing pulling current out of thin air thinks its plugged in when 
its not.. Plug it in to charge yah it starts charging but unplug it thinks 
its still charging and battery even adds percentages unplugged.. Then yah wait about 2 minutes 
then starts draining like crazy and I know it's not the battery because I reset 
it once and it fixed the problem well I reset it again and the problems 
still there this time around !!! damn drawing power solar like with all lights off!! 
I had this phone 2 months when it happened the first time and 2 more 
months when it happened the second time.. Trust me these phones aren't worth your time 
or your money "Stay away from this worthless bunch of blankety blank blank!!!!! Bought my 
GF the blu life 8 xl worked like a charm for two months!! The better 
business burro should investigate this company before they are allowed to manufacture any more of 
these phones!!!!! I ended up busting the studio C over my Knee. They'll drive you 
literally insane!!
