Just purchased this phone for my husband. Went to Wal-Mart to purchase straight talk at&t 
compatible SIM card for it.Thought it would be faster & better than his Samsung galaxy 
3 but it's not; trying to make phone calls & search the web takes about 
5 minutes. It lagged terribly. Paid $229 for this & we are very disappointed. DO 
NOT BUY THIS! WASTE OF $229 when we could of gone up to Wal-Mart & 
purchase the phone.
