I bought this phone to use as an MP3 player to use when running and 
it has performed this task well. I have been shocked at how well the phone 
performs for the budget price. It feels much snappier than my stock AT&T Galaxy S4. 
It can't match the pure power of a flagship phone but if you can deal 
with a sub par camera and lack of LTE, there is no reason to not 
love this phone.As I normally use a 5" inch screen I would be hesitant to 
recommend this phone as a primary entertainment device, but as far as standard everyday use 
compared to price, the Moto E's only real competitor the Moto G. You can spend 
a little more and get a similar device with better specs and a bigger screen 
or you can buy the Moto E and be perfectly happy with it.Again I can't 
recommend this phone enough to anyone on a tight budget or that would like a 
phone to use as a running mate. You can decide for yourself if the sub 
$150 market is where you're looking, or if this is enough screen space or speed 
for you, but you just can't go wrong with a Moto E. You will not 
be disappointed in this phone.
