I've been using this phone for about a month and it's working great for a 
refurbished iPhone 5c! There is a small, minor scratch on the screen that isn't noticeable 
when the screen is on, and a small portion of the apple logo is scratched 
off of the back. But I can't complain because they do warn that there will 
be minor damage on the exterior of the phone. It came with the charger. I 
wanted there to be headphones too, but that's just wishful thinking.
