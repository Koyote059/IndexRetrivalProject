I already liked this phone A LOT, but today it slipped out of my pocket 
while cleaning the gutters and fell 2 STORIES to the CONCRETE patio below and not 
a scratch on it -- works perfectly well (had a cheap $8 Cimo case on 
it - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0115B4ZJY/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The phone is big, bright, fast, has a battery that lasts all 
day long and costs less than half of what some other phones cost.
