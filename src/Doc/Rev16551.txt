These things are super cool. They're cheap, they're android, and if you don't expect much 
you definitely won't be disappointed. So why then only 2*s? I've had to replace it 
once already because of dead pixels out of the box and here I am a 
week later with the replacement phone, dead pixels.It's not just one or two, it's a 
good chunk of the screen.
