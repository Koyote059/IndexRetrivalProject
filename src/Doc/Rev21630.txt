Buyer beware. These refurbished phones are stolen and being resold as refurbished. I bought my 
iPhone 5s refurbished in April 2015. Works okay out of the box. Yesterday, it stopped 
charging so I had the battery replaced by a phone repair store. It worked fine 
again, until the next morning where it was frozen (blank screen and wouldn't reboot). I 
brought it to the Apple Store and they told me it's a stolen iPhone. Apparently, 
the original serial no. of the phone gets reported to Apple when someone repairs it 
and Apple can freeze the iPhone if its stolen.
