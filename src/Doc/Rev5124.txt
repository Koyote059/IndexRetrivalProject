Seemed fine on delivery and worked for a week or so. Then it started switching 
off even with a full charge, wouldn't take/hold a charge, and the battery door doesn't 
engage properly. To get it to charge you have to stand on your head and 
hold the plug in just the right way, right angle, right depth - VERY finicky. 
Even then it might not charge and if it DOES charge it may not turn 
on or even STAY on.Short version -- it's a pink paperweight; nothing more.
