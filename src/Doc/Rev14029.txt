STOP HERE! Don't bother ordering another phone from this manufacturer. This was my second BLU 
phone. Just like my first (which developed a random charging port issue after six months), 
I never once dropped it or got a single drop of water on it...As an 
average user, I didn't root it or anything of that sort. SIX MONTHS after using 
it, one random day while in the middle of a text message, the phone froze, 
turned off, and didn't turn back on. It's considered "uncommon" and has a non removable 
battery and no SD card, so going to Best Buy or Fry's to see if 
they could save it or at least save my pictures was useless. Lost all my 
picture memories of my first semester at University. If you're still using this phone, save 
or sync your pics, videos, or anything important from it while you can, and look 
elsewhere for a decent Android phone..I'm moving onto Motorola.
