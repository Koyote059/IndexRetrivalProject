I ordered two of these phones, one for my son and one for me.CONS:One of 
the phones' chargers does not work, not with any of the phones or other phones 
for that matter. So I have to get another charger elsewhere.The other phone is unusable: 
it shuts down by itself, the battery levels are inconsistent (sometimes it will reboot by 
itself when it reaches 50%, but at boot it says it has 5% left, things 
like that), firmware won't update and it simply does not recognize the SIM card. It 
is basically garbage, or spare parts (if those actually work). I suspect it isn't even 
an original Sony phone, but a cheap knockoff sold as an original.Piece of garbage, and, 
conveniently, they have no warranty (ITL version) so the seller wouldn't do anything about it. 
So I got 1 phone for the price of 2.Buy this if you want to 
get scammed out of $275 (each phone).PROS:The one that DOES work, is pretty good. Great 
battery life. I'd recommend you get it, but from another, honest seller.
