I wrote a bad review of this phone based on a screen problem I experienced. 
The phone was under warranty and once I found the info needed to contact help 
I found the problem was fixed with no pain involved. It took about 2 weeks 
from shipping it to receiving it back. ASUS will provide a loner phone for $25.00 
but my carrier would have made it difficult to take advantage of this provision. The 
phone still has a weakness with screens, but the price, storage, ram and speed of 
the processor are incredible. I believe if you are careful and use an high end 
protective.case the phone should last a long time. To conclude, ASUS really did an awesome 
job with customer service, and the phone is great. PS. To purchase an phone that 
even comes close in features from the big dogs apple or Samsung it would cost 
600 to 1100 dollars. Ouch
