I've been using this for 3 days and can't say enough good things about this 
phone. Forget the amazing sub-$100 price point, this phone stacks up against almost any competitor. 
From doing phone things like talking and texting, downloading apps from Google Play Store, playing 
games and even watching movies, everything has been seamless, fast and exceeded my expectations. Running 
Android M with a powerful enough Snapdragon processor, 16GB of storage (expandable via microSD), and 
an 8-megapixel camera, I have everything I need in a phone. Motorola really built a 
solid, well-spec'd device in the Moto G Play.The ads on the lockscreen are not at 
all intrusive, and I actually ended up purchasing a book I've been enjoying that I 
learned about from one of the ads. I guess Amazon would know what I like 
to read LOL.Best of all, its the first unlocked phone I've found at a reasonable 
price that I can use on Verizon. Finally, I don't have to sacrifice the country's 
best coverage for the flexibility and freedom of unlocked!
