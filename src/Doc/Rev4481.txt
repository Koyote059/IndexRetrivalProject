Easy to use with big bright screen, loud classic ringtone and lots earpiece. Picture dialing 
is nice, but phone has only 70k memory so you need to resize the head 
shots to 5k or use a memory card. Reception is fine, worked well on ATT 
in a fairly underserved area. Flashlight with physical switch. Charging cradle works well.Programming numbers, picture 
directory, etc was not easy nor were the instructions much help.Overall, my 92-year-old grandmother likes 
it and finds it fairly easy to use.
