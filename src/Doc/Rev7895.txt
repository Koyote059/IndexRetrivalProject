The only good phone HTC made was the ONE. and the T-Mobile g1 lol.This phone 
so slow, lag, KitKat, front facing speakers not even as loud as my lg Leon 
I got for $40, not even loud as iPhone speakers so quiet tons of bloatware, 
very little storage space, user interface clunky crowded slow useless and boring. Even installing launcher 
makes phone the still BAD BAD BAD!
