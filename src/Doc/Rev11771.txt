I really like this phone.I bought it for a dear friend and everything is just 
right for her.The 5" size is great and the display is beyond fantastic.The only thing 
that is a problem is activation on Sprint or a Sprint partner.Ting,Ringplus,Tello and others can't 
activate the phone.Republic Wireless can activate the phone but I don't want that carrier.I am 
going to the Sprint Store tomorrow AM and if the phone cannot be activated I 
will have to return it.I have purchased the other Prime phones,Moto G4 and the BLU 
R1 HD and both are performing great.,the G4 on Ring+ and the Blu on US 
Mobile..I like this phone better than the others,it's a shame that I cannot activate it.Oh 
well,I will se what Sprint has to say tomorrow.
