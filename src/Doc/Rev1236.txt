* Summary * the hardware is good, but certain critical apps needed for a person 
living in China aren't stable and cause the phone to behave erratically. If you live 
in the states and use windows for work or home, go for it no questions. 
If you live abroad, test it out and see if the app ecosystem is dependable!I 
use a windows workstation and wanted a phone for work to help access the information 
I need out on the job. This phone is faster than the predecessor lumia 520 
I owned so I'm grateful for that. Skype works fine, and accessing cloud drive (business 
and personal) is easy and fast enough. Cortana hasn't been amazing yet, but she has 
come in useful reading text messages and making appointments in my calendar hands free. I've 
already dropped it from about 1.5 meters and it held up so it meets the 
durability test (one drop only so far!).Also, Here Maps are great and anything related to 
Here in general (driving directions, public transport)! I think that's a big selling point for 
the phone (thanks Nokia!)My real disappointment with the phone that makes me give it 3 
stars instead of 5 is that it can't run WeChat (the main social app in 
China) as fast as iOS! (I haven't tried an Android for comparison). When I use 
WeChat, it frequently cuts out, freezes, alters the sound/microphone settings, and overall just makes the 
phone unstable.If WeChat worked, I would give it close to 4 stars~~~ If other apps 
that are frequently used in China were to work more seamlessly with the phone, I 
would give it 5 stars!
