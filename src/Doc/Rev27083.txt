I'll probably not need anything more than what the phone currently offers, the shape and 
dimensions of the phone can be improved. I was looking to get an Iphone, but, 
the Camera on this is definitely a decisive factor.Compared to the Iphone, I would say 
internet browsing is still a plus for the IPhone (touch screen that is bigger), However, 
you can get what you want from this phone when it comes to browsing the 
net. The Camera on the Iphone can not match this camera.It seemed strange to me 
why the black version was 50-$100 more expensive (and popular) than the silver one, which 
raises the question, why make the silver version?
