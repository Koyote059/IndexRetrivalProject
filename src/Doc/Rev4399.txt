I was looking for a NEW Iphone and purchased from KJ Industries because they said 
they had a new one. When we got the phone it had pictures on it 
and we weren't able to activate the phone, because Sprint said it was stolen. I 
contacted Amazon, and they said I had to go through the seller. He did contact 
me to say that he had to get the phone first before he gave me 
my 300.00 back. The phone was delivered to his home a few days ago and 
I have not heard anything yet. I am going to contact them next. I am 
very disappointed that this is a seller of amazon and he can get away with 
selling stolen phones.
