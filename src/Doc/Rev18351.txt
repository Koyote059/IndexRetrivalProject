My husbands phone just arrived today and he really likes it. He wanted to move 
back to an Android phone...he had a Windows phone he hated. He is very happy. 
I ordered one also and I am waiting for it to be delivered.This phone is 
awesome. It is large and feels nice and well constructed...and very fast. He put his 
current AT&T SIM from his old phone and it worked instantly.I will update my review 
after I get mine and have time to use it awhile.
