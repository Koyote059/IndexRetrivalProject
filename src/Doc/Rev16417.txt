I got a defective phone. It stopped working within a year. The phone is not 
charging and ran out of charge. I tried other charger and other battery, it was 
of no help. I believe the motherboard is not working.I called Amazon, they said they 
cannot provide any support and asked me to contact the seller or Samsung. Samsung customer 
service representative said that all samsung devices have 1 year warranty but since he can 
not recognize the IMEI number of my phone in samsung system he cannot provide any 
support and asked me to call the seller instead. When I called the seller, Wireless 
Experts, Inc they said that there is no warranty on this phone and will not 
provide any support beyond 30 days (90 days in some cases) after purchase, even if 
the phone is defective!I am stuck with a defective phone and have to trash it. 
I am extremely disappointed with the customer service. I feel that I have wasted my 
money and time!Product details:Name: Samsung Galaxy S Duos II (DUAL SIM Factory Unlocked International Version)Model
