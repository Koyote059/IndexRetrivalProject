just an FYI!! Your phone doesn't come with English instructions! When my phone arrived, the 
little box it came in is supposed to be sealed with a sticker from Samsung, 
my seal was broken! I opened it to see if it was brand new it 
was. The language that mine was set with was Romanian, good thing its easy to 
switch! It did arrive on time, like they guarantee! It also comes with 2 chargers, 
even tho 1 is international, it has the American converter, the other is a USB 
charger. Also u can not register it here in America, because its an international phone, 
Samsung will not register it here! Since I had an existing Samsung Galaxy I figured 
I could just switch the Sim card n call Straight Talk to transfer my service 
to the new phone, lmao, they said they couldn't because my new phone isn't compatable, 
so I have to go get a conversion kit! So I just purchased a new 
phone and an activation card and I can't even use my new phone! I need 
a new prepaid phone co!
