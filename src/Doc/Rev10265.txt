This was a very pleasant experience. I ordered this new iPhone 6s with retail packaging, 
with low expectations. The item arrived 2 days earlier, and to my very pleasant surprise, 
it was a brand new iPhone 6s, factory sealed and never activated. It was the 
correct color and all accessories were in the box, factory sealed and brand new. I 
know this because I have a second iPhone 6s I bought form AT&T, and that 
box and contents were identical. I took it to the AT&T shop and had no 
trouble activating it. Overall, this was a very pleasant experience which exceeded all my expectations.
