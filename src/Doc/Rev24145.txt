It is an awesome phone, all the things the people say are true, but as 
far as the equiptment itself is an at&t mobile so beware future buyers, i live 
in Venezuela and this caused me some troubles picking up the 3G band but thanks 
god my cellphone carrier has launched the 4G network in the same band as AT&T, 
i bought it from Tabled Distribuitors, it was delivered within a day and in perfect 
conditions, i bought it with the Trident Case and so far no regrets is a 
beautiful beautiful phone.
