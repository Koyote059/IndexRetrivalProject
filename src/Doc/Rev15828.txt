i had my phone, a nokia 3110 c for 3 years and it has been 
dropped in water, fallen from my bag etc, but my 1 year decided he had 
to throw it extra hard AGAIN and then the screen went bust. so i decided 
to get a new one. i wanted the bronze but thats nowhere to be had 
and Amazon has the best price. i find the grey one more manly and the 
silver feminine thats why i took this one and bought my DH the other one. 
he agrees with me.pros:the best part: the flashlight. i dont know why they dont put 
those standard on a cameraphone.pics are great,its very light,very responsive touchscreen,nice sound [not as good 
as the x press music but that's one dedicated to music],WiFi doesn't need a very 
strong signal3g en wifi! yes!big, easily readible textcons: 1 i have small hands and still 
it is hard to use the touch for smaal things. should've come with a stick 
AND a socket onthe phone to place it in2 the mail makes the pics very 
small before emailing it3 the hand drawing on the plastic screen cover is not necessary 
and hinders me. ps didn't remove wrapper to prevent damage to screen
