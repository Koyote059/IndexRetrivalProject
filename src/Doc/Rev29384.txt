This phone is a brick!I've broken many phones over my smart phone career, but not 
this phone. This windows phone is really easy to use, has awesome contact integration, durable 
and reliable. This phone runs fast, Windows 8.1 Mobile allows for a wide range of 
customization, and now with Windows 10 being released it is about to get even better.It 
comes with tons of free OneDrive storage (~15GB+) and automatically starts syncing all your data 
(contacts, photos, videos, text messages etc...) to your OneDrive account. The windows mobile key board 
is hands down the best on the market (just google "fastest phone keyboard"). Cortana is 
also included as your personal assistant and she really does look out for you. I'd 
say this is the best phone for any business or professional.The only stress I've personally 
experienced was not having Snapchat or my banking apps. The Windows Store app market place 
is young. There are lots of third party app developers that release apps that mimic 
big name apps(SnapChat, Tinder etc..), most of these apps allow you to connect to the 
actual service itself, sometimes these apps can function better than the real thing (Like the 
old 6-Snap, 6-Tin or 6-Tag etc...), but most of time you just want to be 
on the same page as everyone else using the official app. However, with Windows 10 
mobile, I'm sure that will all soon change.A few months ago I switched to a 
Galaxy S6 Edge solely because I wanted to have mobile banking apps and Snapchat. I 
absolutely can't stand my new S6 edge (I have to restart my S6 Edge daily 
because the OS get's very glitched/slow after a short period of use), it doesn't even 
come close to Microsoft's careful attention to detail & functionality when developing their mobile OS. 
I never had any issue with lag on this phone, even after almost completely filling 
up my storage with photos, documents and apps.I've owned both iPhone and Android devices and 
this Windows Phone was the icing on the cake. I would prefer to use this 
phone over my Android any day of the year.There's a lot more to be said, 
but I would take the time and research if Windows Phone is right for you.I 
highly recommend this phone based off my experience and I see a bright future for 
all Windows Phones.To find out more, check out their website: https://www.windowsphone.com
