My experience with the product was not great.The product came in a great box of 
goodies,PhoneBatterySuper Charger (for extra fast charging)Blu HeadphonesClear Phone CaseScreen protection sheetProduct's battery life was amazing! 
lasted as long as they said it would.However it seemed to be running errors with 
a key app I use (NOVA launcher)After about 2-3 weeks I start seeing errors in 
the software outside of NOVA launcher. Contacts would not save, nor text messages.This was extremely 
frustrating. After factory resetting the phone the issue persisted. I had to ask for a 
return.If there were no software issues I would give this phone a 5 star review 
and would be using it right now.
