This phone, although used, is far better than the phone I had before it fell 
in a bucket of water. I tried everything to dry out the old phone because 
I did not want to have to buy a new one, and was worried I 
would not be able to find another LG Remarq. Sprint, my carrier, was no help, 
as they no longer sell this phone. However, one of the vendors we shopped with 
suggested looking on Amazon. It was great! They had several vendors, and varied prices, ranging 
from brand spanking new to well used and poor condition. I chose the slightly used 
one, and am so happy with it. I've been happily using it for several months 
now. The charger works better than my old one, and has a light to inform 
me when charging is complete. It looks brand new, and the price was very reasonable.
