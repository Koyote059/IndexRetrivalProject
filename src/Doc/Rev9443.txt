Came as advertised and in time, not much to say about this known product.My first 
review was positive but I am modifying my review. I needed an Unlocked Cell phone 
to be able to use it abroad.a few days ago it fell and got the 
screen messed up.I took it to repair and waited in the workshop while it was 
being fixed.Much to my surprise the person fixing it told me and showed me that 
the phone had been open and the parts being replaced where not original, it had 
a screw missing and parts of the screen circuits where not glued like the originals 
are.It never affected the performance of the phone but I suppose it shouldn't have been 
sold as new when it was probably refurbished.
