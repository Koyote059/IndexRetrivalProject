I bought a refurbished version of this phone. Never again will I buy anything electronic 
that has been refurbished. It was great at first, but now, only 5 months of 
having it, had developed extremely annoying issues. Some of which are costing me time doing 
my job. At times, the Internet connection dies and the icon disappears from the status 
bar (even with a solid digital signal). It does not return on its own. I 
have to restart the phone each time. Average rate of occurrence is twice weekly. But 
now, in the last couple of days, the speaker will not play any sound at 
all. Volumes in all places are checked and found to be at max setting. A 
litmus test using an app that bypasses phone volume settings in favor of its own 
only has vibrate functioning then as well. Soooo, restart required for that as well. I 
don't know its frequency yet. This thing isn't starting to become a remorseful purchase; It 
has already become that. Especially for the price it cost. Never ever again.
