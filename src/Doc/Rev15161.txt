I am a huge blu studio fan, but unfortunately my Blu Studio 6.0 had a 
crack on the screen, so I decided to give the Studio Selfie a try. Let 
me tell you, you get what you pay for! This is basically like a Nokia 
Lumia except it is an android (I know, because I've had a Nokia Lumia). I 
was so disappointed with the quality, I think the 2mp camera on my 6.0 is 
better than the crappy so called "5 MP" camera" that the Studio Selfie has. I 
would highly not recommend this phone for someone who has experienced phones such as a 
samsung, iphone, or etc. I am going to return this phone IMMEDIATELY. I am so 
disappointed. I think I am going to stick with the Blue Studio 6. Oh well.
