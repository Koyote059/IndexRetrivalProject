Great Phone for everyday use, I came from most of the nexus phone lines and 
this is phone rocks them all. Powerful battery life and ease of use in the 
hand, great camera, fast photo taking, flick of the wrist camera is open, hoover your 
hand over it and you get time display, very responsive when apps are opened, no 
bloatware at all on this phone, AMOLED screen is nice.. Negatives I can think of 
is it needs MORE MEMORY like 4GB. Camera Bump could easily break if no protection 
is on it. Gorilla glass would be nice for protection.Overall this phone is a great 
buy
