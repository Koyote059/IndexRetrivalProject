I got the phone in a very timely manner! :) It was exactly in the 
shape they said it would be. "A few wear and tear scratches, but looks very 
good." They were right, the back had a few scratches, but nothing that my Otterbox 
would not cover over anyways! :) The screen was perfect, not one scratch on it! 
I am NOT a technology person, and I didn't understand the "No SIM card" thing. 
I had no clue that it was a needed thing for my phone. However, I 
took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, 
no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and 
the phone. It was a great price for the item that I needed and I 
will be sure to come back to this company again for a phone in my 
future!:)
