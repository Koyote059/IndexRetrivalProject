i am so glad i bought this phone on amazon. it was 20 dollars more 
on the actual boost mobile website.I bought this phone for my mom and she loves 
it. she was new to android so she didn't expect much. but when she found 
out all the stuff it could do she fell in love with it.i give this 
product 5 stars because it made a great gift for the holidays and there is 
nothing wrong with the phone. i was scared to do the water test only because 
of my own experience with phones and water.the only thing negative is that after i 
did the water test. you couldnt really hear anything clearly until the water drys.
