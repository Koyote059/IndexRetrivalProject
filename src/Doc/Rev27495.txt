Great phone but I ha to get a different sim card from Verizon because requires 
a nano sim card instead of a micro sim card. But the phone I received 
had a weird stain on the back, idk, and the speaker made this weird crackling 
noise, I thought the phone might be water damaged, but the phone itself is really 
nice. It runs 5.1 lollipop after updating it from KitKat, lollipop update runs smooth as 
butter on the phone.OK let's talk about the camera. The quality isn't 4k but it 
gets the job done, the camera runs really smooth and has great photo editing tools. 
One of my favorite features of this phone is, if you twist the phone twice, 
it automatically turns the camera on, its great for when you want to get a 
quick pic.Other features are the voice activation feature, you can name your phone what you 
want. Also when you say the name it automatically starts the voice control, even when 
the phone is on standby. I use the feature all the time for directions, music, 
and just to ask questions.Build QualityThe phone is very solid and feels really nice in 
the hand. I don't use a case and I've dropped it a few times and 
yet no cracks. But I recommend a case and a screen protector. Like I said 
before it looks like a small iPhone 6 but smaller. Most people like big phones 
but this phone is perfect size for my hand. I can text comfortable with only 
one hand (unlike iphone 6) and just feels good.The reason I dropped it a star 
I because the specific phone I got had some flaws and the seller didn't tell 
about them. Like I think it has water damage because the phone makes these weird 
crackling noises sometimes. And theres a weird stain on the back that won't come off. 
Even with alcohol wipes lol.The price is really good for this phone. This phone runs 
the same software as 600 $ phones!Overall I would buy this again. Love the phone. 
I hope this review was helpful. If you have any questions I'll answer them!!Below are 
the front and rear camera picture qualities.
