My 92 year old Mom thinks this is a great phone.., she can hear comfortably 
with its volume levels and because we set-up the phonebook for her, with one touch 
she calls whom she wants. Simple is best for her and this phone was well 
thought out for older folks with less than great vision and hearing. The easily understood 
'Yes/No' function buttons are perfect...If someone needs a basic phone with no clever functions or 
buttons, this is ideal, you can't go wrong...
