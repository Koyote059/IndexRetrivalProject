The Samsung Galaxy Alpha, Ill judge in 5 CatagoriesCamera: Blurry indoors, Selfie camera is slow, 
blurry and noisy. In good lighting it performs like it should. 7/10Screen: Super saturated, Colors 
seem to pop and the screen is amazingly sharp. It is a bit warm, and 
whites seem to be yellowFeatures:The finger print scanner is a nice touch though it takes 
usually 2 tries before I can actually get in. The IR blaster works as expected 
though the app could use some work.Design: Its beautiful. There are chamfers every where and 
they definitely took a page from apples book.Performance: All phones perform the same nowadays and 
you should expect perfect performance
