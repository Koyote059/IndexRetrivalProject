One MAJOR drawback: the charger doesn't meet USB-C specs. For more information read this reddit 
thread: [...]I can't believe LG would include a non-compliant charger and that Google would allow 
it. They need to offer replacements to all Nexus 6P/5X owners. The whole point of 
a standard is that everything's interchangeable. I shouldn't have to worry about which cable and 
which charger I use with each device. Why not just head back to 1999 when 
every cell phone manufacturer had their own plug?Otherwise here's a run-down on the phone:Pros:* Size 
is reasonable. A little smaller would be nice but the weight is terrific. It's like 
keeping a feather in my pocket. I tried the 6P for a week and it 
was just too big and too heavy. I loved everything else about the 6P but 
it was unusably big and I have average-sized hands (wear a medium in latex gloves).* 
Fingerprint reader. This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. I use the Lastpass password manager and they 
are a fantastic combination. I haven't typed a password since I first loaded Lastpass. I 
cannot recommend this strongly enough. I never used Android Pay on my old phone because 
it was too much hassle. Now I use it regularly.* No bloat. My past phones 
have always come with a skin (Moto or Samsung) and it's great not having to 
root to get rid of it. I've also always bought phones through Verizon in the 
past so I've also gotten their junk. No more preinstalled ESPN!* Fast updates. In the 
past I've had to wait first for the device manufacturer and then Verizon to release 
an update. Now I'm getting the latest OS (and even running a beta for Nougat.)* 
Rapid charge: much like the QC 2.0 on the phone it replaced the rapid charge 
performs as advertised. Roughly a percent a minute until you near 100%.Cons:* First and foremost, 
the non-spec charger. This is ridiculous. I hope LG & Google get it together on 
this one.* Battery life. Mine is terrible. Worse than the nearly 2yo Droid Turbo it 
replaced. There are people out there getting several days out of theirs but I'm certainly 
not one of them. I'm a very heavy user with lots of apps. I USE 
my phone, and for more than just a paperweight. It's great that the phone's so 
lightweight but I would have happily traded another half ounce for a battery that would 
make it 'til noon.* Memory. I took another step backwards here, 2 GB on this 
phone vs. 3 GB on my Turbo. I figured it would be fine, that Google 
knew what they were doing. Wrong. Now if I step out of a game to 
answer a text then when I come back the game reloads and I lose my 
level.Would I buy it again? I'm really not sure. Ideally I would have held out 
for October to see the new Nexus lineup but once I got a taste of 
the fingerprint reader there was no going back.
