Received the phone and I like the phone. I would recommend the phone to others 
for the price.. The only down side is, I don't like the echo of my 
voice when talking to others. Also sometimes people on the other end say it sounds 
muffled. If I put it on speaker phone both of these will go away. So 
I talk a lot on speaker phone needless to say.
