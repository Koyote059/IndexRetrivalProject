So far, so good. It updated to Marshmallow right away, the storage is great (16GB), 
the size is not as enormous as many phones out there (I already have an 
I-pad, thank you). The screen is still a good size for videos and pics. I'm 
using it with Ting sim, I also have in there another Sim for when I 
travel home (outside the US), and the external memory so it can hold up to 
3 chips at the time.The speakers are not the best, volume capacity is kind of 
disappointing (good with headphones, and comes with a pair), charger looks cheap and the cord 
is short, and that is why I give this 4 stars.
