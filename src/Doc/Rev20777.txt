ADD ON: The company contacted me and I shared the issues with the product. The 
are making everything right. So, they get an additional star. The phone is actually a 
pretty decent phone for the price. No personal information will be on it, so if 
I lose it on my trip, I won't fret about it. Definitely recommend if you 
are going on an overseas trip. The international sim card I bought fits perfectly. (End 
add on)The box was ALREADY opened. The additional color cover for the phone is not 
inside. Probably stolen by the person who opened it. I gave it three stars because 
it updated functions many complained about in their reviews. I only bought to use out 
of the country. This is never going to be my primary cell phone. I would 
send back, but trips around the corner. If all else fails, I'll use WiFi to 
communicate with folks. I never planned to make calls, send texts, etc... I'm on vacation, 
those actions defeats the purpose of being on vacation. So, for what I am using 
it for, this cell will do.
