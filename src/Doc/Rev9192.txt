Very good phone. It is an amazing upgrade from the Zenfone 2. It is TW 
from Taiwan but it's all in English since you configure on the first start up. 
It came in a original box with a really good earbuds, USB type C charger, 
manuals and an ejector tool. I thought I wouldnt come with earbuds as on a 
US version but it surprised me but it is in-ear and I decided to buy 
another one. The fingerprint sensor is super fast and precise. The camera upgrades were worthy. 
The 3 gb RAM is doing faster than my one-year Zenfone 2 4GB and the 
Zen UI 3.0 is clean and faster. I never needed a launcher and now it 
is better than ever. It is working with T-mobile 4g so it is really unlocked.
