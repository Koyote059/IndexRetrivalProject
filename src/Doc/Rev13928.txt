It may not be a "State of the art" smartphone but if your a person 
that just wants a functional, reliable, simple phone this is the phone for you. I'm 
not the kind of person that likes touchscreen phones because I like to have a 
physical keyboard to text on. Granted, it takes some time getting used to but its 
a pocket sized phone that you can bring anywhere! It has the perks of a 
smartphone, yet a classic phone feeling. Its a nice affordable phone to have and I 
would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a simple, yet sleek smartphone.
