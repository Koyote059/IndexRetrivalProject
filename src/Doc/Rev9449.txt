Apple and Gmail don't play well together. I had to download the Gmail app in 
order to get email notification sounds, since the iPhone's mail app won't do it. Facebook 
notification sounds are inconsistent. There are some really nice thing about this phone though. I 
love the vibrancy of the display. I like text dictation. I do like the extra 
large format, though there is wasted space. The screen should really go to the edges.
