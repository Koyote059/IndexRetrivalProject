I got it few months ago but still can't use it though I'm in the 
states. I have my US number, put it to Nokia but that number doesn't work 
with this phone. I showed that phone to some phone sellers and they said that 
I have to have a code to activate this phone. And i can get the 
activation code from seller only. I bought it from Amazon and they don't put seller 
contact for this phone. I don't know how to activate it. I need advice who 
already use it, please, can you advice how can I activate it?
