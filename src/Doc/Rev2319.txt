I really relied on the Questions and Answers by Seller in the item description giving 
assurances this phone is the BBZ30 (Model: STA100-5) which is compatible on T-Mobile's LTE network. 
When I got the phone, I was out of town so the fact that it 
didn't immediately log onto the LTE network didn't cause me undo concern.But when I returned 
home, still no LTE where my other Blackberry (the Q10) picks it up easily. Yesterday, 
working with T-Mobile, I was able to confirm I was sold a phone that is 
not compatible with their LTE network. I received an STA100-2. I looked it up and 
it appears to be a Z30 designed for European networks.Now need to go through the 
pain of returning the phone and ordering a new one - this time, directly from 
Blackberry, which I probably should have done in the first place. Amazon said they are 
merely the shipper so they couldn't even do an exchange for the proper model number 
(my initial preference), though their customer service was outstanding as usual and makes me a 
very loyal customer to Amazon.This is the fault of the Seller who did not sell 
me an LTE compatible phone as promised. Buyers beware...
