The watch is decent but its still missing a lot. I paired it with my 
iPhone 6s and I liked that I was able to get notification alerts. However, the 
alerts pushed any notification that came through my phone and the maximum amount that it 
shows on the watch is 5. Every time I got any sort of alert it 
would say I have 5 new messages even when I only had one new one 
and the rest were old. You can't reply back to anything and the UI is 
laggy. The watch interfaces had a small selection and none of them were to my 
liking. The phone option is probably the best working part about this and the option 
I would use the least. You can actually call directly from the smartwatch, there is 
a dial pad, speaker, and mic. When using the Siriâ option, it works ok but 
it acts as if you are calling yourself. Overall, it's a nice smartwatch for the 
price but I would rather have more compatibility.
