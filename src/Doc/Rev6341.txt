I was looking for a smart phone with high functionality and flexibility for productivity rather 
than entertainment. I suppose what I wanted was a device that I could do all 
that I wanted to do but in a 'cool' way, not so much access to 
some 'cool' things that I would not really want to do, so I looked around 
and got the E71 and I am very pleased.The more time I spend customizing it 
the more indispensible it becomes (and it has just been 3 weeks). There is also 
a large online Nokia and Symbian community that help you find a lot of good 
apps and highlight important functions.I recommend-- the eye call app-- sms preview app-- nokia messaging 
client (i am using the free trial at the moment)-- vlingo (you can send text 
messages just by speaking to your phone)-- spending time to create shortcuts and customize buttons-- 
using the "search" function (allows you to search everything from google to your sms outbox)
