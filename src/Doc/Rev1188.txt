I was unsure about the phone when I purchased it. I'm a fan of the 
Samsung Galaxy family having bought a Galaxy 2 Tab about a year ago but I 
wanted a smart phone that would give me the opportunity to use both my sim 
cards. I wanted a phone that was not some knock-off version and my friends kept 
telling me that the dual sim phones were no good. Thankfully, I can say that 
it's a pretty decent phone. One thing I will warn others about, however, is that 
if you have original sim cards that are not microsims then get replacements just in 
time for purchasing this phone or you will be in a spot of bother.
