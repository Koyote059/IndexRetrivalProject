I purchased this phone a year ago and was satisfied until I needed to update 
it - I can no longer access Google Play Store, my SD card is not 
being recognized, my camera is not working, etc. I did a factory reset but that 
did not resolve my problems. POSH said I needed to update the phone but I 
was unable to update it with the flash file information sent via email. My husband's 
phone gets automatic updates sent to his phone on a regular basis. I do not 
understand why POSH does not automatically send updates to the phone and instead expect a 
customer to update via an email and when it does not work they do not 
offer any assistance. At this point I regret this purchase (thinking that I would have 
been better off with a well known name brand phone) since I can no longer 
access all of the features of this phone and POSH customer service has not corrected 
the issues.
