Very nice phone.As a Mac user, I was almost buying Iphone. But I'm a little 
bit clumsy too, so I opted for this model that looks like it's a little 
more resistent to clumsyness.I realy can't say about Iphone because I don't have one. Until 
now, N81 resisted some falls to the ground.One more thing. For Mac users, you can 
Isync just by dowloading a driver that you will find at nseries website in the 
workshop area.
