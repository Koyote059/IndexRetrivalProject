When I first got the watch I really liked it. I thought it was great 
for the money. The sound quality of both the built-in speaker and microphone were great. 
and included apps were useful.However, this all changed after about 3 weeks when the watch 
suffered a fatal malfunction which was not fixed by resetting or removing the battery. among 
other things the menu reverted to Chinese only and would not let me go back 
to English. it also started randomly setting alarms which went off in the middle of 
the night.
