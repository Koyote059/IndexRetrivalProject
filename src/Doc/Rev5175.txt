This phone isn't just a novelty item. It's a fully functional, fully usable, TINY smartphone. 
It can sit in airplane mode for a week, fits in the fifth pocket on 
a pair of jeans, and can actually get pretty damn loud. I bought it not 
expecting much much than something to show off at parties (it's scary how accurate the 
keyboard is considering how tiny the screen is). I don't plan on doing too much 
with it, I've ended up carrying it as an EDC emergency phone, but there's certainly 
nothing holding it back from replacing a larger phone.
