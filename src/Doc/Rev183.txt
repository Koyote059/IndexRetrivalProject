I come from the iPhone... I love the iPhone or should I say... I loved 
the iPhone.My iPhone 5 broke on me a while back and like a guy that 
wants to know if the neighbors wife better than his own, I decided that I 
wanted to try an android phone.Since I come from an top tier Phone I went 
and bought the top tier... HTC one. That was a greatish experience and I kind 
of enjoyed it... but then I lost it somewhere (probably in a cab).Since my first 
Android experience with the HTC was somewhat good and I was sick of breaking or 
loosing 600$+ phones, I decided I would buy a middle of the road, not to 
pricey, ok phone.Then the Moto X came in the mail: Holy Crap! Snappy as hell, 
every thing I used to run on my high end phones runs just as smooth 
on this one. But that is not what makes this phone stand out.Stock Android + 
a few tweaks like the active display and touchless control sets this phone apart... More 
than that, it sets new standards, something that very very few phone have done in 
years.I could not go back to a phone that would have me press a button 
to display the time. Sound trivial.. maybe it is, but I'm lazy and you are 
to... you just don't know it yet.Touchless control is great... I love seeing the jealous 
eyes of iPhone owners when I say "ok google now" without touching it and the 
screen pops up.Other android phone makers should take notes here: Why invest money in designing 
a stupid custom baked layer of creamy OS crap on top of the already excellent 
Android (looking at you HTC and Samsung) . Vanilla Android is oh! so much better, 
lighter, cleaner, sleeker, snappier and simpler.You should not care about this phone specs:Get this phone!It 
is the proof that 700$ phones are overpriced and overrated.
