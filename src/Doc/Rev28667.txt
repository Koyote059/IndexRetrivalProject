Pros:UniqueVery good AudioWide variety of games availableCalls are generally very crispVery good phone for the 
priceCons:Design makes it hard to make durable casesWhen indoors reception is terribleScratches very easilyWhen dropped 
3 feet with a case on onto the carpet the screen spiderwebs very badlyI have 
owned this phone for a year now. Its is a very good phone but there 
are quite a few problems with it as well.First off the screen scratches really easily 
and I'm talking you put it in your pocket and its scratches quite badly. Secondly 
the signal is terrible indoors and isn't really great outside either. I average 1 bar 
indoors and 2-3 outdoors while I would get a 4 bar constant on my other 
phone with the the same network. Finally As the last con the screen breaks incredibly 
easily i basically dropped it 3 feet with a case on, onto the carpet and 
the screen spiderwebbed. It was quite disappointing. However this phone has a lot of great 
features as it manages to keep calls crisp even with the poor reception and the 
audio is simply amazing and It really works well for all types of music.
