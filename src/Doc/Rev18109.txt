Nice looking phone. It works well. Worth the price. Update: I returned the phone after 
using for only a couple of days. The phone overheats when charging, and downloading updates. 
There was a small 42mb update and the phone heated up to 105 f. The 
back of the phone was very hot to the touch. During a large update it 
would probably shut down or burn out. At the least the life of the phone 
would be cut way short from the overheating. Also there is an extra button on 
the right bottom for the camera. The camera would come on with the phone in 
my pocket. This phone would be really good if those problems would be corrected.
