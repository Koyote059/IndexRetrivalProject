Excellent phone for less than $200. The build quality is great, screen is good (720p), 
OS is near stock Android Lollipop, included a good quality case that is textured on 
the back to provide a better grip, screen protector and headphones (so-so, but free!).A few 
issues that prevent it from being a solid 5/5:If you've installed a launcher and reboot 
the device, it will load the stock launcher instead and you'll have to select the 
default launcher again.GPS has failed once before trying to navigate. A reboot fixed that issue.Also, 
my usage is pretty minimal (no games) Mainly streaming music, text, web browsing and I 
average about 7 hours on a single charge. Longest I have used the phone was 
about 12 hours.I'm on Cricket in the DFW area and I get LTE.
