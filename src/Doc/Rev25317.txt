I absolutely love Posh smartphones but the experience does not translate to the tablet. It 
is fine looking and well built unit but the screen image makes it close to 
useless. The camera is so bad I have to assume there is something wrong with 
it because it is about equal to an old flip phone camera. The processor also 
seems slow and the experience is choppy,It's cheap but it works and seems sturdy. I 
think this is a perfect device for young children to play with and destroy. If 
you are on a very tight budget I would say it is a fair value 
at under $100 and will do basic task fairly welk.
