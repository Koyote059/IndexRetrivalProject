I've only had this tablet a day and to be honest I love it. It's 
my first ever and so far I'm having a lot of fun with it. It 
comes w/ several pre loaded apps such as Twitter, Facebook & Youtube and two games, 
one being Angry Birds. It's pretty easy to use and it is unlocked so you 
can use it with any Sim card. I used my T-Mobile one just to see 
if it would work and it did while having an extra slot for another Sim 
card. It also uses Wi-Fi (as well as 3G/2G) and you can watch videos on 
it/connect it to your computer to add photos/songs to it.The only complaint I have is 
the battery life seems to run down at a sort of, steady rate I suppose. 
You get I think 5hrs after charging and then it ticks down bit by bit. 
It's not too bad but if you're gonna be on the move and can't recharge 
for a while it's something you should keep an eye on. However you can charge 
it while using it but I suppose that's not too good for the battery. All 
in all though I really like it and so far it's doing exactly what I 
needed it to do. I'm hoping it works for a very long time.
