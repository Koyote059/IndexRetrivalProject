I picked this up after first owning a Samsung note2, Note3 and then switched to 
a Nokia 1520 windows phone which a LOVED over the samsungs... The battery life was 
nothing short of INCREDIBLE.... but I switched after nearly two years to the Nexus 6P 
which was a flagship... and I found out after only a few months that quick 
charging isn't as good as NO charging... That Bluetooth doesn't work as well as windows 
phones in that it doesn't read text messages over BT and allow you to reply 
verbally... SO, I switched back to my old Nokia until it died a horrible saltwater 
death after being on a few kayak trips with me... I finally picked up this 
640XL as a temporary replacement and I gotta say... This is a fantastic device! The 
pics are good, the battery lasts all day, it can run the latest WP10.. it's 
just a great all around device. I'd pick this inexpensive windows phone over a $400 
Nexus or Samsung any day of the week... It's just that much better for the 
price.
