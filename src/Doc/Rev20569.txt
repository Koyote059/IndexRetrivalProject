The phone itself is in wonderful condition and holds a charge pretty well but the 
charger included, was not a turbo charger. I understand it comes with an aftermarket phone 
charger but it should alreast be a turbocharger charger. Also the metal part of the 
charger that goes in to the phone completely bent and broke. I don't even know 
how so that charger is no longer good. Ugh .
