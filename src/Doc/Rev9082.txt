I purchased this phone which was advertised as "NEW" in Dec 2015 - It recently 
became unresponsive so I took it to Apple assuming they would help me under their 
one year warranty - they informed me that the phone was originally activated in 2013 
and on top of that, it had a non-apple replacement screen installed and the sub-screen 
was damaged and that is why the phone no longer worked. Because of all this, 
there is nothing Apple could or would do- had it been a "NEW" phone like 
I thought, they would have fixed or replaced at N/C since it was within one 
year of activation..... Basically this is a refurbished phone and since it has been 6 
months, I am out of luck. Very bad experience :(
