For starters, this thing does not run LTE and barely runs 4G. The feel of 
the phone is a little cheap. Its not very heavy and you can take the 
back cover off really easily. The version of android is a little old but gets 
the job done. On the plus side it does come with some average headphones, an 
okay case and a screen protector. The main camera is okay, it doesn't handle movement 
very well. The front facing camera is terrible. And make sure that you get the 
8 GB model because the operating system itself takes up like 2 GBs. Also make 
sure you get a SIM card adapter for this phone because it only accepts full 
size SIM cards, not micro or nano cards. There are lots of flaws on this 
thing, here's another: This phone can barely stay attached to wifi which means you constantly 
have to refresh the wifi in order to stay connected. Also the battery life is 
terrible and it can barely make it through the day. ALL that being said, it 
is only $120. And for $120 it is pretty good. Basically as soon as the 
Motorola Moto G 2nd GEN LTE comes out I'm ditching thing this because, as a 
temporary phone, its fine. I couldn't imagine using it every day though.
