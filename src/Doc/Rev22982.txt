Ive had my phone now for a few days and it is very impressive. It's 
sleek and attractive and worked great outof the box. I am with Cricket Wireless who 
is owned bt AT&T. I put my GSM SIM card in from AT&T and the 
phone is workinv flawlessly. it boast a huge 5in screen and the colors are superb. 
This is NOT the HTC Butterfly...so dont expect the same features and upgrades. The BEATS 
audio is killer!!! I use my phone while im working out at the gym...Planet Fitness 
of course, all you hear is the music. It seems to be a good phone 
for the price point.
