I purchased this to use for T-Mobile USA, and it works really well with 4G 
LTE so far. The camera is great, especially the manual mode and wide angle camera 
options. The DAC is a great feature that really boosts volume and audio fidelity. It 
is pretty fast, has a lot of screen real estate, and pretty much has not 
too many "frills and perks" loaded by cell phone carriers in terms of software.I got 
this for $625 (no tax), way cheaper than what US stores are selling it for. 
This version includes the B&O H3 headphones, and they are a great compliment to this 
phone.This phone does initially come in Traditional Chinese, though, and there are a few Taiwanese 
apps that you may want to uninstall, but much better than what you would get 
on T-Mobile. The setup for LTE is a little more complicated (well, not really) in 
that you need to restart the phone in order to "activate" 4G LTE after you 
have activated your SIM. So far, I have not found ways to use WiFi calling 
or VoLTE. However, these last two things are minor and I think the rest of 
the phone will blow you away!I have two videos on this phone:unboxing: [...]activation and changing
