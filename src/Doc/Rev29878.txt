Claim ... Good day, I did not find any other way to make claim. In 
my credit card, there is a charge for $ 79 I do not know to 
apply because my purchase is 99.49 dollars for a black berry and samsumg 198.98 for 
two phones. Now send me an email telling me I should check my payment method 
and do not understand why? Show me please what is the reason why we can 
not make the payment because they correspond to 79 dollars .. can write to desiree15784@hotmail.com
