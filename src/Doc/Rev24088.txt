I was honestly afraid of what I would get but I have to say I'm 
very pleased. First I thought the phone wouldn't be compatible with Simple Mobile because it 
wasn't unlocked but after using wifi to activate the phone, I was connected to the 
Simple Mobile network. The phone is in good condition and really has no sign of 
use and the processor works well. The only problem was the headphones that came with 
the phone. The mic didn't work for long.
