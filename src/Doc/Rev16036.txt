Such a disappointment. I had high hopes for this one. Dual SIM & 100$, sounded 
too good to be true, and it was. The screen hardly senses touch and the 
camera is terrible! That said, I was traveling and needed a Dual SIM phone and 
this did the trick. No fear of losing or breaking it! Then, of course, I 
did break it and the only way to get it fixed is to send it 
to Southern Telecom, which charges $75 for shipping. Yes, that is what two costumer service 
representatives told me ( I called and had an online chat). Also, costumer service was 
terrible. One was so busy reading the script, they asked me the same questions 10 
times, but would not answer mine. The chat representative answered "You can do that" to 
my question of whether or not they had a dealer in my area - I 
never even said where I was chatting from. Just w/ customer service alone, I would 
rather buy a new phone - def not polaroid!
