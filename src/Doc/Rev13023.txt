This phone after being reset to factory settings, started to work properly with T-mobile and 
a European SIM card. Price is good, phone is not the latest on the market, 
but does what is supposed to do, and actually I think it has the right 
balance of what one needs out of a phone. The selling company was nice to 
call me after the first negative review and offer to replace the phone. Quite happy 
with the purchase.
