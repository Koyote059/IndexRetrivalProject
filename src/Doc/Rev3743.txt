great phone great screen good battery life and good sound. Hard to beat even if 
it is last years model. They have since released Pro G 2 but it has 
not hit USA yet. When it does it will likely be a killer phone as 
well. This one was AT&T branded so it has some bloatware to remove, but functionally 
and cosmetically perfect. They did not include the headset which is odd, but the price 
point was excellent. There are perhaps 4 or 5 other phones out there now which 
can compete, but most are at least an additional $100 dollars or more.
