Gorgeous phone. Aesthetically ranks 10/10. Amazing look and feel to it. But.....andt this is a 
major deal breaking but!This phone runs extremely hot. I mean hot enough to cook your 
dinner on. It's really a shame as I was trying to convince myself to keep 
it despite this major flaw. But the reality is if the form doesn't follow function 
then it is useless as far as I am concerned.I really hope Sony tries to 
make another iteration of this phone without the Snapdragon 810 processor. The phone is too 
thin to dissipate the heat generated by this monster processor, and the design of the 
phone prohibits the effective use of this chip. Apparently a software patch will be out 
soon, but this will only serve to slow down the processor. At the end of 
the day, this is a hardware issue.I don't know what else quite frankly I'll be 
purchasing as I don't think anything comes close to it in terms of aesthetic appeal.On 
another note, the phone was shipped in an unsealed box. I am not used to 
purchasing new phones in an open box, and it would be nice if the vendor 
stated this before shipping it.
