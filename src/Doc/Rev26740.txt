This is tiny! A lot of people think it is a toy, but I've been 
using it for about 2 months now and it works great. I just wanted something 
to talk and text, I use my tablet for the web searches and facebook, so 
I just wanted something that fit in my small purse nicely. I downloaded a swype 
app so I could text better because it is really difficult to text without it. 
I also get random texts every two weeks or so from GoDaddy and one other 
online place. I assume they got my info from this phone purchase because I never 
got them before. (hence the 4 star rating) It's definitely a conversation piece. It uses 
real Android technology, so my google calendar is on here (the only other thing I 
was hoping I wouldn't lose when I went smaller)
