This phone is beautiful, I paid a little more to get it new in its 
original box but it was worth the extra money and wait. It has an smooth 
and easy to use keyboard and it fits like a glove in your hand. The 
screen resolution is crystal clear and you do not miss a detail. Many people said 
they had problems with their phone being locked onto a carrier, but I inserted my 
SIM and I am picking up AT&T flawlessly. The touch screen is responsive but you 
sometimes forget it is there due to the thumbpad. One of my favorite feature is 
that it tuns off and locks when you put it in the holster, but it 
turns back on and unlocks upon retrieval. The holster it comes with does not have 
a clip, so I recommend buying one. Overall, it is a great phone and I 
would buy it again.
