I am a Georgia Resident (USA) and T-mobile User.. I am tired of paying ridiculous 
prices for new phones and having them break all the time. Warranty is too expensive 
and only cover a couple of times. And half the time buying an older or 
used phone it ends up having something bad that I didn't know until long time 
use or it dies on you. So I though I would give this a try. 
The quality of these phones are actually decent and they work really well. They do 
not have the Bloatware (T-mobile apps, AT&T Apps, Verizon Apps, Etc) that most phones and 
thus makes it seem fairly fast. Long time I am not sure how long these 
will last but at a range of $200 or $300 for some, it is not 
life or death if they fall and break as compared to those $600-700 phones that 
you get in the store. This one in particular made it good for the screen 
size, similar to my S6 Edge. The only difference is quality in screen but it 
is still fairly different. If you are trying to the latest phone, at half the 
price, just compare the specs of these phones (RAM, PROCESSOR, STORAGE, BATTERY SIZE, ETC.)
