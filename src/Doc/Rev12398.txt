I use this with Straight Talk Unlimited Talk, Text and Data @ $45 / month 
and I couldn't be happier with how well the FIGO Atrium performs. The screen is 
5.5 inches, which makes it a Phablet ( Phone & Tablet = Phablet ). The 
display is crystal clear HIGH Def and perfect at any viewing angle. Using the Atrium 
for Netflix streaming movies and a great experience and I've been quite surprised by the 
headphone sound, although I do link it with my BOSE Bluetooth speaker, so I don't 
rely on the phone speakers, or the headphone. However, the phone's speaker's are the best, 
but they are adequate. I would say that the speaker is the only weak point 
with the phone. The dual SIMM's is nice if you use the phone for personal 
and work. It's always nice to have 1 phone that handles 2 phone #'s. The 
APPS load plenty fast and never hangup. I use this for my car's engine performance 
monitor / Virtual Dashboard with a Bluetooth>> ELM327>>OBD2 Link. All in all, you'll be very 
happy with this phablet if you use it for Movies, Music and verious apps. I'm 
not into Video Games, so I cannot comment on how well this would perform. I 
do, however, occasionally use my FIGO Atrium as Quadcopter Remote Controller with the WiFi and 
I completely trust that the FIGO Atrium will work flawlessly, or risk losing my quadcopter.
