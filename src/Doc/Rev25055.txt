I have had this phone for about a month now. If I were pickier I 
would have sent it back, but I don't use my phone that often. It randomly 
shuts off all the time. It always takes a moment for whatever button I hit 
to register. It gets on my nerves sometimes, but all in all, it gets the 
job done.
