Have had several blu phones and loved them. This one is absolutely junk. First I 
noticed the crapy hard plastic case it comes with. Then I also noticed it came 
with hard plastic earbuds. All of the other blu phones i have had come with 
soft rubber cases that are great as well as earbuds with soft plastic tips. now 
it's not even 3 months old and the screen touch has gone crazy. It selects 
one spot over an over as long as there is something to be selected. I 
have tryed several things to fix it but still same issue. Only thing it is 
good for is my alarm as long as i dont need to change it an 
the clock on the lock screen.I'll give blu one more shot on the next phone.
