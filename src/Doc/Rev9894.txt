cool size... but so small that it is nearly useless but as a phone and 
reading SMS. Responding to anything via the keyboard is taxing. it is so small and 
the digitizer is not ver accurate making for a impractical device. The Android kitkat OS 
is stripped down, glitchy and not intuitive. The Clock kept disappearing from the status bar. 
There is no OTG support, and the USB charging port is so deep all other 
cables are nearly useless. that is just poor design. the screen is so small most 
apps, webpages, etc are forced off screen or the text is forced into a intolerable 
vertical format. The battery is poor and the indicator is useless. The softkeys are lighted 
only and the light goes out very fast making navigation frustrating... and there are almost 
no settings to control anything. The settings are not all in one place as you 
will find trying to change the lock screen image.That said it will run netflix and 
other streaming services. the bluetooth devices I paired worked fine. It tan NES and SNES 
emulators with little lag, but had to use a BT game pad. the FM radio 
was a cool bonus in the face of US released phones...wanted this to be awesome, 
and for what it was it was "neat" but nearly useless. if the screen area 
was larger to the phone outer size it would be awesome.even with NOVA launcher, and 
other tweaks this phone is just not practical for daily use. Good backup or emergency 
device.
