Phone was delivered on time, Brand new with new packaging, good Seller (The Wireless Circle). 
Will buy the same phone from the same seller again.The phone is a DUAL CORE 
phone (two chips), so EVERYTHING is processed faster. I have had a Quad Core computer 
for almost four years, and it still beats everything out there, so having more chips 
speeds up anything. 2012 will be the year of Dual Core phones, so this was 
slightly ahead of its time/future competitors. I chose this over a Nexus S and a 
Galaxy S II (all three unlocked) because this phone will do 98% of what those 
two phones will do at about 60% of the price!!! Great value for your budget.Tip: 
Get an unlimited data plan for this phone (from your phone carrier). It will soak 
up anything (data-wise) you can throw at it...already downloaded 400 megs in a day and 
a half of initial usage! And not one lockup or slowdown! Came with Android 2.3.3, 
so very happy with the software side of things...Battery: Get a bigger battery folks..this phone 
uses up battery power like you won't believe (on the standard battery). When you open 
the box, CHARGE it first for a few hours (overnight?), only then use it..then let 
the battery discharge all the way down to ZERO before you recharge it again...apparently these 
batteries need to be fully charged and fully discharged (the first 5-10 times) before they 
will accomplish their full range. The bigger battery (had to buy it seperately) charged up 
fine in the car from the cig lighter (3 hours). Turn the GPS off to 
save battery power. Already has a battery app on board, so you don't need another 
battery app.Phone: VERY easy to use, big large buttons. Hangup button is red (center button 
on screen) or you can configure the Power button to be the hangup button. MAKE 
SURE you turn OFF the mobile hotspot button otherwise you will be burning through your 
data plan. It defaults to ON when the phone turns on the first time (at 
least in mine).Texting: Easy to use buttons (on screen)..although the one complaint i have (andriod 
software) is that it constantly corrects names or words it doesn't recognise..you have to press 
the word that is all the way on the left side to let the word 
stay in the sentence/text (the one you just typed). On the other hand, it DOES 
suggest words as you are typing, so you don't always have to type the whole 
word.Internet/Data: You will be addicted to the speed of this phone! Enjoy!!!User Manual (in box). 
Good pictures etc, but i found the online manual MUCH more informative.Overall: GREAT PHONE for 
the price. Equals or beats most of the high dollar whiz bang phones out on 
the market now (Jan 2012) at about 60% of the price. Will be buying the 
2nd one shortly (same seller).
