After only 7 days of using it, the phone blanked out and lost all data. 
The phone would not restart. Had to take it into a Authorized LG service center. 
The technician came up with the following analysis -1. There is no IMEI number listed 
anywhere on the phone2. Everything on and in the phone was a duplicate except the 
mother board - from the battery to the cover to the components3. The speaker was 
spoiled4. The charging unit had to be replaced as it was not original and was 
not assembled currentlyI ended up paying $125 in repair charges and out of commission/without a 
phone for 7 days.Am very surprised and feel cheated.
