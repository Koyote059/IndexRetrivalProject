(this phone bought from Cellphone Lifestyle). So far, the phone is working well and wasn't 
DOA. However, the inner box itself had a white sticker on both sides (which could 
have been generic - nothing to indicate LG or Google) and the outer blue cover 
with the NEXUS logo wasn't sealed to the box. The phone was in Japanese upon 
startup and the phone had already 2 text messages (dated 26 Aug) from YMobile suggesting 
someone must have got it free from them and sold it off onto amazon resellers. 
So I am slighty taken aback by this. I thought the phone was supposed to 
be brand new?
