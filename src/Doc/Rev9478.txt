I order this phone thinking it was new since it had been describe as new, 
but the phone was not new it had signs of being used. I also had 
a problem with the battery. when the battery died completely; sometimes i had to take 
the battery out and than put it back in order for it to recharge... Something 
is definably wrong with this phone am returning it back getting an different phone... Very 
dissatisfy with the phone. On the other hand i do have to say that i 
like the Windows OS the problem for me was the HARDWARE...
