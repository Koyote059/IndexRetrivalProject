Five stars just for the battery alone. I used to have the droid razr and 
had to keep it plugged in constantly and keep the data and location services off 
or the phone literally drains within a couple of hours. Taking it anywhere where I 
had no ability to plug in was useless and it would get extremely hot. However 
in addition I have never had a phone of this quality. Iphone shmyphone, this phone 
kicks all other phones ass. I never purchased a tablet because it would be useless 
to me based on my lifestyle and personality. I mostly text and talk, email and 
research. I not really heavy on the social networking thing. So with this I have 
a great phone that will allow me to casually engage the internet as needed. I'm 
in love with this phone.
