I received my phone yesterday and have already put in the return request as defective. 
I have TWO other Blu phones and I am pretty happy with them (Life 8 
and a Life Play 2), but this one had massive battery drain. In 10.5 min 
it went from 100% to 83% and that was on wifi while adjusting the power 
saving features. It seems as I played with it that it didnt drain if I 
didnt use it, but when I did use it, even just for small things it 
drained quickly. Its sad really because it felt great, reacted great, nice screen size, but 
I didnt get into much more since I got caught up in trying to stop 
battery drain. I did a factory reset twice just in case the update did not 
load correctly but nothing changed. Nice looking phone, but a cell phone is useless if 
you have to treat it like a corded wall phone. :(
