I bought this phone as being unlocked. It wasn't. I called at&t and they registered 
my simms card and went to turn it on. Nothing! Why? It needs a simms 
card with unlocked pin? At&T didn't know what I was talking about? Nice phone to 
look at. So I'm going to try to take it to the corporate At&t store 
and then probably to Apple Store. I will give a better review after I drive 
a hour to these stores. Check out my new review. Didn't have to drive. grreat 
Phone! clear reception and voice. No problems. Yes I woould recommend this seller 100%
