I have been using this for about a month on my iPhone 5. This replaced 
a LifeProof case which is much more expensive. The LifeProof case wore out after about 
a year (good design, poor durability).PROS: It was easy to install and provides good drop 
protection. Not too bilky.CONS: I don't like how hard it is to use the mute/unmute 
toggle switch on the left side of the phone. You have a open up a 
flap of the case, toggle the switch, and replace the flap. Kind of a pain, 
if you mute/unmute your phone several times a day like I do. Also, the fit 
of the rubber skin is poor at the bottom, but this is a minor thing.
