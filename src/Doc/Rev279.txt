SO I was debating between the Iphone 5s and this phone, and am so glad 
I went this this one. It can get all the same aps or close to 
it that does the exact same thingl as the Iphone and have never had a 
problem with it after 2 months. Works flawless. (only thing I didn't care for was 
the phone ap that came with it(kept accidently dialing people), so downloaded a different ap, 
and it works so much better. No regrets
