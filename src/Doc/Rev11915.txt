Fantastic device, great specs, extremely smooth and snappy. The price is fantastic for what it 
is. The minimal skin they put on over vanilla Android is great. No problems caused 
by the UI or any of their custom features.So why 3 stars?There's no way to 
enter the Bootloader. Can't unlock the device. Can't replace the Recovery. No root, no custom 
ROM. Complete lockdown. Not cool.I returned mine because of how locked down it is. Hopefully 
they open it up in the future. This *could be* an amazing phone, but at 
this moment it's crippled by the inability to control it the way I want.
