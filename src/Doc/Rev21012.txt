This is a fantastic phone! My husband is a truck driver, and needs a heavier-duty 
phone as he is accident prone. I decided on this phone, and don't regret it 
for one moment. He's already dropped it a few times, and you couldn't even tell. 
He's quite happy with the speed of the device in comparison to the other prepaid 
AT&T Android phone he had- the processor wasn't able to keep up. This phone, however, 
is quick, designed well, and fits well with all of the other Samsung products we 
enjoy. I have yet to find one Samsung device that doesn't meet our needs!
