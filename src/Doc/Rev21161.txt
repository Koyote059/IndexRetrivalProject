Chicago cellphones sent me a IPhone that they describe as new. Two months after the 
purchase the home button intermittently stopped working. I have called Apple and ATT. They have 
updated the operating system and I have cleaned and reset the button but to no 
avail. I complained about this issue a week or two ago and have not heard 
back about what might be done. I saw that Chicago Cellphone Ltd now has 20% 
of their phones were marked with one star. Can you help me with this?
