Greatly designed phone.Fast, beautiful, elegant phoneStereo speakers made the phone to work nicer than any 
other one in the market in terms of playing videos and music using the built-in 
speakers.Excellent sound using the headphones (I have Beats headphones) and they sound really similar to 
them. Difference is not noticeable. (Maybe there are "hidden" Beats, who knows)One thing you should 
knowi is that it comes with Android 4.4.2 and this OS has a restriction using 
the Memory card (MMC) this is a Google thing not the phone's, so that is 
why I did not lower the rating. Passing files to the memory card from the 
internal memory is not allowed unless the application installed has permissions to write to the 
MMC. I had to root the phone and modify the permissions to remove this restriction.
