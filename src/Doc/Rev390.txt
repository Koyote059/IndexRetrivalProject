I bought this phone for my wife because she was wanting a phablet and her 
neice has the BLUE STUDIO 5.0 and has been very happy with it.HOWEVER, my wife 
has used the phone for about a month and there are some things that have 
been annoying to her. For example: there are times when a call will come in 
and she swipes to answer and the call ends. Other times the phone will ring 
for a 5 or 10 seconds and then the call ends. (This happens often enough 
not to be a case of someone changing their mind and hanging up. And it 
happens very rarely on my phone). Sometimes the phone will start scrolling uncontrollablly. I think 
that these issues may be due to the STUDIO 6.0 LTE being a new phone 
and given a year or so to get the final bugs worked out, it could 
be a great phone.
