If you are an American, and not on Verizon, then the only true flagship available 
to you in November of 2014 is the enormous Lumia 1520 (a year old already). 
The Lumia 830 is not a flagship (217 ppi screen resolution is one of many 
shortcomings). That leaves the Lumia 1020.I will not review the phone itself here, since there 
are many reviews on the internet (mashable, cnet, engaget etc) that you can look at 
to learn what an amazing device this is. I will only add that those reviews 
are out of date since the phone was released over a year ago and you 
should take the following into account:1. The app selection has increased substantially since this phone 
was released (Vine, Instagram, Uber among many other major apps are now available)2. Microsoft and 
Nokia have released a number of meaningful updates.3. Shutter lag was a problem when the 
1020 was first released but firmware updates since then have addressed this substantially and the 
Nokia Smart Cam app takes a burst of photos so you won't miss action shots 
anymore. Shutter lag is not a big issue anymore.I can confirm that without a SIM 
card inserted, this device upgraded all the way to Windows 8.1 (OS version 8.10.12393.890, see 
attached screenshot). This means it has a fully functional Cortana as well as a notification 
bar and the Windows Phone version of Android's Swipe, which works quite well (I also 
own a Nexus 7 tablet). The 1020 is unlikely to receive any more updates but 
it should be more than able to hold its own until a proper successor is 
released.I will also add that with a T-Mobile SIM card inserted, it picked up LTE 
immediately in downtown San Francisco (see screenshot of notification screen, also new with Windows Phone 
8.1). This is the RM-877 device, which is compatible with the T-Mobile LTE bands.The Amazon 
merchant Phones4selling was okay - the phone was definitely new but the box was not, 
suggesting it was OEM (but really, who cares?). The phone ships from Texas by USPS 
and reached me in 5 business days in San Francisco.
