I ordered this phone six months after spending $200 on an Alcatel one touch because 
it erased my memory card and I would have to reboot it at least 8 
times a day to get it to acknowledge my sim card. Needless to say, I 
was very irritated and had next to no expectations outside of having a phone that 
I wouldn't have to reset whenever a stray wind blew by. So, I had the 
BLU shipped overnight and was happy when it was on my doorstep less than 18 
hours later. I had no problems having my straight talk service switched over and syncing 
my new, very vibrant yellow phone. Its been a few weeks now and I couldn't 
be happier, this phone is everything its hyped to be. The speaker is loud, the 
picture is clear and crisp, the screen is incredibly responsive and gaming is awesome. The 
battery life is fantastic, I work 10 1/2 hour shifts all while listening to YouTube 
and I wind up having to charge it partially sometimes. Every other phone I've tried 
this with I've ended up charging every three hours or so. I use this device 
as a computer, an mp3 player, a camcorder, a camera, a television, a newspaper and 
a phone and it has surpassed all my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone 
who needs a dependable device that can take heavy use.
