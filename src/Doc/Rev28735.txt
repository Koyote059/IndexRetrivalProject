The overall design of this phone is quite good, this version samsung phone does not 
"overheat and bursts into flame" as the new version 7 seems to do. build wise 
it is a big phone made of hard plastic which has good and bad points 
unlike plastic/metal construction of other phones such as iphones. The phone according to samsung uses 
gorilla glass or a similar durable glass but in my opinion its best to use 
a screen protector because the screen is not particularly hard and will scratch. there are 
software issues between the "sideSync" samsung software and my windows 10 pc but that may 
be just my setup, as an android device it works. the menu is a bit 
clugy but all the controls are there one just has to hunt to find them. 
over all this is not a bad phone to get, specially as a secondary phone, 
even more so if you are outdoors a lot.
