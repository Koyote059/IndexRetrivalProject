I bought this because of the great reviews. Everything was working great once I got 
the phone set up but despite multiple attempts I can not get it to recognize 
the SD card. I used one I had but no luck. Then I bought a 
new one from Amazon and tried formatting that two different ways but no luck. Mount 
SD is just greyed out. I looked online to get help and it looks like 
I am not alone. The SD card is a huge reason I bought this. My 
Nexus 5 had NO storage. SO this is a big deal to me.***UPDATE: I got 
another G3 from Good Guy Electronics and am VERY happy. SD card reader is working 
so it is clear to me that the first phone I got from Breed was 
defective. I am also starting to wonder if the Breed phone was used or refurbished 
but labeled new. Below is a picture of the two phone packaging next to each 
other. The one on the left is from Good Guys which also looks like packaging 
that I saw G3 comes in when I went to Best Buy. Overall I love 
Amazon because as soon as I told them the phone was defective I got a 
refund. Great customer service and the reason I am such a loyal customer.
