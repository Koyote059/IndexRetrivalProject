The speaker did not work. I had to trade it to Verizon for $43 because 
my 11 year old son had been waiting to activate it. We took it in 
to activate it and it didn't work so I had to buy one at Verizon 
so as not to disappoint my son on his birthday, He brought his grades up 
to earn it. I was out $60 and got a phone contract I did not 
want.
