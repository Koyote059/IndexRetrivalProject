I've used this same model of phone before, it's not a smart phone but I 
like it because it's small and light. This time I order two Nokia 5310, one 
for me and one for my wife, the red one for my wife is okay 
but my black one is really bad, the battery can last only one day while 
it should last about 3 days according to my normal use. The worst about this 
phone is the listening volume, it's so low that at first I thought I suddenly 
had hearing problem, then I try my wife's red phone (same model bought at the 
same time), I knew that the problem isn't my ear but the phone. When the 
phone arrived I notice there's dust inside the screen, so I suspect it's a rejected 
one, but the seller sold it to me as a 'brand new' one, I paid 
for it at a 'brand new price'
