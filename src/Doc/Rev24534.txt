This phone is awesome. I haven't felt this good about a purchase for a long 
time.Why 4 stars? I do not like the fact that they put the camera shutter 
right beside the switch to video button. They should have put a separate button that 
allows you to switch from camera to video mode, and leave the shutter button alone.Too 
many times I click on the shutter, just to find that it's recording a video. 
By the time I realize it the moment I wanted to capture has passed.Major annoyance.Other 
than that, I have nothing to complain about this phone.June 24 update:I had to remove 
another star because the volume is really really bad. Unless you're using the phone in 
a completely closed and completely quiet place, you can't hear much. I have never had 
to set the volume to the highest level on any of my devices before. I 
guess you could use earphones, but I feel like this being a phone first and 
foremost, call quality should be good with no external help.Hopefully they can send a software 
update that can improve the volume/speakers, but I doubt it.June 26, 2014I had to come 
back and change rating to 4 stars again. This phone has the best battery life 
out of the box. I didn't do any settings, tweaking or battery saver app installed. 
So I'm impressed. I decided to put the 2 above mentioned problems under minus 1 
star instead of minus 2.PS: I love the face unlock feature as well. Good job 
Blu!
