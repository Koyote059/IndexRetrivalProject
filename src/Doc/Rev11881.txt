i bought this phone as an upgrade from the Lumia 800. it runs very smooth 
and is responsive.all the apps i like to use are available. the camera and vid 
functions are also very nice you wont be dissapointed.one option i do like was the 
wireless charging covers. you remove your old cover and put this one on in its 
place.i had got a few different colors so i could change my phone theme from 
time to time.i was not going to buy the wireless option because i thought it 
was just a cover that you place over the phone. after i seen it was 
an actual body replacment i changed my mind. the covers look original not an extra 
hanging off the phone.I think its a great deal for a phone in the 200 
to 300 dollar range. the functionality and options are worth twice that amount.
