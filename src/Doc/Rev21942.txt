I bough a unit from Amazon Warehouse Deals that was repacked.Unfortunately the device is now 
presenting battery issues after 4 months of regular usage and I'm also living abroad and 
the manufacturer does not provide support .I liked the phone but I will not recommend 
buying it from Amazon Warehouse deals with the US warranty only.You can spend a few 
more bucks and get one at Best Buy or any other shop that has better 
warranty.
