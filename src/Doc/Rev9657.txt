You can pretty much get a feel for this phone from reading the specs. Mine 
is black with the plastic back which is still kind of grippy. Aesthetically, the phone 
is sexy. It feels really good to hold and look at. That said, for my 
taste it feels wider than it is long. Obviously it's not, but it's wider than 
I'd like it to be, minor thing I guess. The camera's good, not great but 
definitely not as bad as some reviews make it seem. Obviously it doesn't perform as 
well in low light, which the iPhone is really the only one that does. But 
you won't be disappointed with this phone, the few things Motorola adds to the software 
are actually useful. Battery is okay, I'd say average and could definitely be better. But 
you should make it through the day.
