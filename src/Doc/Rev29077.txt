From iphone 5 to Galaxy S5, then returned S5, then got Nexus 6P, Got the 
Iphone 6s Plus, threw nexus 6p in the trash...basically confirmed that Apple products are the 
best hands down. Android is still unreliable, and material design is not as intuitive as 
the mvc model. A lot of really anoying things in the design of the operating 
system of android phones. Hopefully they change things up, but for now I roll with 
the best.Love photos are a blast if you value your pictures and moments in life.
