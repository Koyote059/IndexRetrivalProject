Been using this phone now upgrading from the blue 5.0 HD which I loved. This 
thing is amazing it's faster, clearer, lighter, thinner. If you are thinking about getting it, 
don't wait. Top quality phone with a incredible price.Update...after a month of heavy usage I 
still have nothing but great things to say about this device. I've installed close to 
100 apps and still no hesitation at all. Loads of pictures, I mean you name 
it I've tried it. And the battery life is great too heavy usage 10 hours 
almost constant apps web browsing streaming music in the background and it has about %20 
at the end of the day. Just love it.Update....after 4 moths of super heavy usage 
i still have nothing but absolute love for this phone. Ive taken probably 3500+ pictures 
with this phone, all still on the internal memory, tons of apps, and it just 
keeps going like its brand new. Havnt had to do a reboot or anything to 
this device yet. I did get prompted to update the phone, seems it only updated 
the radio app, and that went flawlessly. Blue really nailed this one on the head.
