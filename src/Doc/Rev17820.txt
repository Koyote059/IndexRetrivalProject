When I first unpackaged this I tried many features and I loved it. But then 
the problem. I have owned cell phones for well over 10 years going back to 
the basic Nokia. And I have owned many cell phones, I love a challenge and 
something different. So I was perplexed that my SIM card wouldn't go into the phone. 
It just didn't fit! I tried two different adapters. The SIM card fit the adapter, 
but the adapter wouldn't go into the cell. It seemed just slightly too big. It's 
a nice phone with great features that seem to all work, but if I can't 
call and text, I can't use it. I am returning the phone.
