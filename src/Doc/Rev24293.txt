Pretty simple, 5 stars because the phone functions for a moderate level phone user. You 
can call/text/use the internet. (All I need really). IMEI numbers were clean and phone still 
functions perfectly. I assume you can get a similar functioning phone for a lot cheaper 
but if price is not a concern then this phone will do the trick. I 
would recommend to a friend.
