I do love the watch, the only issue is the battery life. Maybe it's just 
mine because my friend uses hers all day and sometimes doesn't even need to charge 
it at night. I am giving it a few more days to see if it 
is just my battery and if so, going to see about switching it out, if 
possible. Other than that, great buy!
