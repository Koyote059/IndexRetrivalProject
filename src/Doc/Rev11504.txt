I want to love this phone, but it overheats in 15 minutes after doing practically 
anything.A lot of the overheating can be delayed by uninstalling or disabling the Sony bloat 
apps. Unfortunately, the X-Mobile display enhancement adds to the overhead and when it's turned off, 
causes a lot of stuttering to go away.I was ready to live with the problems 
because of the beautiful case and size, but it's impossible. The overheating causes stuttering in 
the daily use after about 10 to 15 minutes of use.I think the only thing 
that could save this phone is a CPU throttling, but I just don't want to 
do that for a phone of this expense.REVISED: I lowered the star by one due 
to seller concern.
