Paid $800 only to get a fake iPhone!First of all, the charging animation is not 
Apple's at all. Second, the silence button is crooked. Third, the phone was used from 
when I opened the box, even forgetting the fact this is not an iPhone. You 
can obviously tell as well this iPhone is fake: I mean, look at the grammar. 
Apple or any company wouldn't do anything like this, and this doesn't look like stock 
iOS.
